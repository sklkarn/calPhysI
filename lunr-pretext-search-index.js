  "title": "Preface",
  "body": " Principles of physics uses calculus as a tool to correlate physical theories to mathematical equations to learn physics. This book is a concise form of my lecture notes which I have been delivering in introductory level physics courses for many years. This text is not a replacement of any textbook that has been recommended by the instructor but designed to provide additional materials as my personal teaching activities in calculus-based physics. It is intended to support introductory level materials at a rapid and an efficient way. Students who want to use this text assume to have a prerequisite knowledge of some basic mathematical skills such as geometry, algebra, trigonometry, and some advanced mathematical tools such as a differential and integral calculus.  Learning skills by memorization that have been built in many students during other courses, cannot work efficiently in learning physics. Physics is a logical and conceptual based learning hence it requires a completely different pattern of study than simply trying to memorize lists of formulae or examples. This book is organized into two volumes and ten chapters that covers the syllabus of introductory physics at undergraduate level in various universities and colleges. Volume I contains the Basics of Mechanics, Fluid Mechanics, and Thermodynamics.  Volume II contains Electricity, Magnetism, Simple Harmonic Motion, Waves, Acoustics, and Optics . These topics have been carefully chosen to provide an introduction to the basic concepts in physics and to give an opportunity to sharpen critical thinking and problem solving skills. The main objective of this book is to learn how to investigate and approach problems in a logical manner. This book strives to guide readers to learn physics in a logical manner. Many examples and practice problems throughout the text may be helpful to refine physical intuition.  To tackle the physical problems the book uses the 'GUESS' strategy for a systematic gatheing of information and finding realistic and logistic solution. Here is what GUESS stands for.   G: Given, identify the given information and sketch the information if possible.   U: Unknown, identify the unknown that we are looking for.   E: Equation\/s, set up the equation from given information.   S: Substitute, substitute the number\/s in the equation\/s.   S: Solve, solve the equation to obtain the answer.  Comments and suggestions for improvements to the text will be gratefully accepted -- Author   "

  "title": "Derived Units",
  "body": " Derived Units   Derived units are the unit of such physical quantities which depends on the base physical quantities via a mathematical relation between them. Some of the derived units are expressed below.     Area =   i.e. in SI system, in CGS system, and in FPS system.     Density =   i.e. in SI system, in CGS system, and in FPS system, (lb stands for pound).     Speed =   i.e. in SI system, in CGS system, and in FPS system.     Electric resistance =   i.e. in SI system.     Magnetic flux =electric potential   i.e. or wb (weber) in SI system.      Dimensional Analysis  We can express the derived physical quantity by the dimensions of the base quantities. The dimensions of mass, length, and time are written as [M], [L], and [T], respectively. The square brackets round the letter represent dimensions of a base quantity. The dimensions of any other quantity will involve one or more of these basic dimensions. For example, the volume occupied by an object can be expressed as a product of length, breadth, and height, hence the dimensions of volume are . Similarly, velocity is a distance divided by a time, and hence the dimensions of velocity are . The dimensional equations of speed [v], force [F] and mass density can be expressed as , , and .  Dimensional analysis is a method in which the relationship between different physical quantities (or units) can be analyzed by identifying their base quantities (or units). Dimensional analysis helps convert the units of one system into another system or helps check the resulting formula in a physical process. Some quantities have no dimensions and they are called dimensionless quantities, e.g. the ratio of two lengths are dimensionless. The dimensional consistency does not guarantee the correctness of equations. It is uncertain to the extent of dimensionless quantities or functions. Dimensional analysis is based on the principle of homogeneity which states that the dimensions of both sides of an equation are same. For example, in the equation below dimension on left is equal to dimension on right.   To verify that let us use the principle of homogeneity, i.e., which implies that both sides of the equation has the same dimension, hence this equation is a dimensionally correct. It must be noted that a dimensionally correct equation need not be an exact (correct) equation, but a dimensionally wrong (incorrect) equation must be wrong.  Use principle of homogeneity to find the time period of the oscillation of a simple pendulum which is dependent on its mass, length, and the acceleration due to gravity. principle of homogenity From the given information, we have - or, [where K is a dimensionless quantity] Equating the power on both sides of the dimensional equation, we get - and    Some derived units are summarized in the table 1.2.

  "title": "Errors in Measurement",
  "body": " Errors in Measurement  Measurement is a base of science. In every measurement there is some uncertainty. This uncertainty is called an error. The concept of errors can be understood by knowing the terms accuracy and precision. Accuracy refers to how closely a measured value agrees with the correct (true) value. Precision refers to how closely individual measurements agree with each other. For example, suppose the true value of a certain length is near 5.678 cm. In one experiment, the measured value is found to be 5.5 cm by using a measuring instrument of resolution 0.1 cm, while in another experiment, the length is determined to be 5.38 cm by using a measuring device of greater resolution, say 0.01 cm. The first measurement is more accurate (as it is closer to the true value) but less precise (as its resolution is only 0.1 cm), while the second measurement is less accurate but more precise. Thus every measurement is approximate due to errors in measurement. In general, the errors can be classified as (a) systematic errors and (b) random errors. The errors that appear due to faulty instruments or imperfact instrumental design are known as systematic errors. It is a repeatable error in the measurement. The systematic errors are     Instrumental errors: These errors arise due to imperfact calibration or design of the measuring instrument. Usually they are called a Zero Error . It is either a positive or a negative type. These errors can be removed by correcting the measuring device, e.g., in vernier calipers the zero mark of vernier scale may not coincide with the zero mark of the main scale.     Personal errors: They arise due to wrong observations, an individual's bias, lack of proper setting of the apparatus, e.g., parallax error, a person viewing a car's speedometer from the driver's seat will get an accurate reading because she has a direct line of sight. A person viewing the speedometer from the passenger seat will overestimate the reading because of the viewing angle between his eye, the meter, and the arrow.    The errors that appear due to system noise or disturbance of measuring location are known as random errors. It is a unpredictable and non-repeatable. Experimental error is one of the random errors. Experimental errors arise due to some external conditions of the instrument such as pressure, temperature, humidity, or magnetic fields, e.g., a thermometer placed under the armpit will always give a temperature lower than the actual value of the body temperature. This type of errors may also occur due to random and unpredictable fluctuations in experimental conditions (e.g. variation in temperature, supply voltage, local atmospheric pressure, etc) and personal errors (e.g., change in readings if the observer repeats the same observation).

  "title": "Significant Figures",
  "body": " Significant Figures   Significant figures are the digits which give us useful information about the accuracy of a measurement. The result of a measurement includes digits that are known reliably and the last digit that is uncertain. For example, the length of an object measured to be cm when measured with a meterstick marked with centimeter (0.1 resolution) and has four significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7 are certain while the last digit 5 is uncertain. If someone measure the same object with another meterstick marked with millimeters (0.01 resolution) one could have measured the length to be 287.54 cm and that contains 5 significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7, and 5 are certain while the last digit 4 is uncertain. Each smaller measurement allows observers to determine the length of the object with a bit more accuracy. Maybe someother can measure with great accuracy as 287.542 cm. No matter what you do, there must be some inaccuracy always come at every measurement. Scientists account for this unavoidable uncertainty in measurement by using significant digits. significant digits do not remove the uncertainty but warn readers to where uncertainty lies.   has one significant digit: only 1 is interesting and reliable. The zeroes may have been just the placeholders; they may have rounded something off to get this value.  1000.0 has five significant digits: the \".0\" tells us about the accuracy of the measurement that the measurement is accurate to the tenths place.  In scientific notation if 200 has two significant figures then is used. If it has three sig.fig. then is used. If it had four then 200.0 is sufficient.  Here are some basic rules to determine significant figures:    All nonzero digits are significant; in number 0.003004500 the digits 3, 4, and 5 are significant.    All zeroes between significant digits are significant; in number 0.003004500 the 0, 0 between 3 and 4 are significant.    Trailing zeros in the decimal portion are significant; in number 0.003004500 the 0,0 at end of 5 are significant.    Trailing zeroes in a whole number with no decimal shown are not significant; in number \"540\" there are only two sig.fig. 5 and 4, the last 0 is not significant.    Leading zeroes in the decimal portion to the first non-zero digit are not significant; in number 0.003004500 the 0 to the right of decimal point and digits 0, 0 to the left of decimal point before the digit 3 are not significant.    Exponential digits in scientific notation are not significant; has only three significant figures, 1, 3, and 2.      Rounding off the Numbers  When rounding, we examine the digit following to the right of the digit that is to be the last digit in the rounded off number. The digit we are examining is the first digit to be dropped.  If digit to be dropped off is less than 5, then drop it off with all the other digits to the right of it.  If the digit to be dropped off is greater than 5, then increase the number by 1 to the preceeding digit to be rounded.  If the digit to be dropped is 5, then round the preceeding digit so that it will become even number. Zero is considered to be even when rounding off. This is the process of minimizing systematic error. Here are some examples:    Round 742,396 to four, three, and two significant digits: To round to four sig. fig. start with the first significant digit, which is the 7. Then count to the right from there. The first four significant digits of 742,396 are the 7, the 4, the 2, and the 3. Just to the right of the 3 is a 9. Because this value is \"greater than 5\", round the 3 up to 4. Replace the remaining digits (the 9 and the 6) with zeroes. Then: 742,400 (four significant digits).  To round 742,396 to three places, start again with the 7 and include the next two digits, being the 4 and the 2. Since the next digit is a 3, which is \"less than 5\", leave the 2 alone and don't round up. Replace the three digits after the comma with zeroes. Then: 742,000 (three significant digits).  To round 742,396 to two places, use only the first two digits, which are followed by a 2, so don't round up. Instead, just replace the final four digits with zeroes, to get: 740,000 (two significant digits).    Round 0.07284 to four, three, and two significant digits: To round 0.07284 to four significant digits, start with the first significant digit, which is the 7. (The zero between the decimal point and the 7 is not significant, as it serves only to \"place\" the 7 into the hundreds place.) There are only three more digits, so all of them will be included in answer. Since no digit follows the 4, there is no information about rounding, so just leave the 4 as it is. Hence, 0.07284 is four sig-digs.  When rounding 0.07284 to three sig-digs, the final sig-dig is the 8, which is followed by the 4. Since 4 is less than 5, so simply drop it. Because these sig-digs are after the decimal point, not replace the 4 with a zero. Hence, 0.0728 is three sig-digs.  To round 0.07284 to two sig-digs, use the 7 and the 2. Since the 2 is followed by an 8, round the 2 up to 3; drop everything that follows. Hence, 0.073 is two sig-digs.    Round 425.35 to four and two significant digits: For four sig.fig. this number is 425.4, because the value to be rounded off (3) is \"odd\" and followed by a \"5\", then round the 3 up to 4 and remove the remaining digits. For two sig.fig. it would be 420, because the value to be rounded off (2) is \"even\" and followed by a \"5\", then leave 2 as it is and replace the other with zeroes.      Mathematical Operations with Significant Figures     Addition or subtraction: The final result should retain as many decimal places as there are in the number with the least decimal places in the data. For example, the sum of the numbers 436.32 g, 227.2 g and 0.301 g is 663.821 g by mere arithmetic addition but the least precise measurement (227.2 g) is correct to only one decimal place. Therefore, the final result should be rounded off to 663.8 g. Similarly, the difference in lengths of 66.25 m and 23.3055 m is . Which can be expressed as 42.94 only.     Multiplication or division: The final result should retain as many significant figures as are there in the original number with the least significant figures. For example, if mass of an object is measured to be, say, 4.237 g (four significant figures) and its volume is measured to be , then its density, by mere arithmetic division, is 1.68804780876 upto 11 decimal places. But density should be reported to three significant figures.      "

Acceleration relates to velocity in graph in the same manner as velocity relates to position in graph . Curvature in position-time graph gives the instantaneous acceleration. Since the slope of the velocity curve, , is the time rate of change of velocity, or which is called the bending function of the position-time curve.    Reading of graph                   The specific features of motions can be read as follows from the graph: If position, x is increasing, then velocity, v is , if position, x is decreasing, then velocity, v is , if velocity, v is increasing, then acceleration, a is , if velocity, v is decreasing, then acceleration, a is . The slope of x t graph gives velocity and the slope of graph gives acceleration. The area under graph gives position [ ] and the area under graph gives velocity [ ]. Note that even if the shape of these graphs look weird all the motions happen only in one dimension, i.e., going up or down with time .  From , slope of line AB=+ve, slope of line BC=0, and slope of line CD =-ve, which means the object is running with constant velocity along +ve direction, stays at rest, and again starts moving with constant velocity along -ve direction, respectively. The slope of bottom portion of curve DE =0 nd that at top portion is +ve hence the object is speeding up in +ve direction. The slope of bottom portion of curve EF =+ve and that at top portion =0, hence the object is slowing down in +ve direction. The slope of top portion of curve FG =0 and that at bottom portion is -ve, hence the object is speeding up in -ve direction. The slope of top portion of curve GH =-ve and that at bottom portion =0, hence the object is slowing down in -ve direction as can be verified in figure . If velocity is constant there is no acceleration and if velocity is increasing in +ve direction, acceleration is +ve, if velocity is decreasing in +ve direction, acceleration is -ve, if velocity is increasing in -ve direction, acceleration is -ve, if velocity is decreasing in -ve direction, acceleration is +ve as can be seen from graph .

  "body": " Rules to follow while solving motion problems:     Linear Motion Problems: When motion problems become complex (say, more than one object involved, or a single object experiences complex motion) one must subdivide the problem into several sub-problems according to the following steps:  Draw pictures of the situation at the critical times denoting when one sub-problem begins and another ends. Label the drawings appropriately, indicating the positions, velocities, accelerations, and times involved. Use subscripts to distinguish the variables in one sub-problem from another.  Write the appropriate equations for each sub-problem.  Write the equations that relate one sub-problem with the others.  List the given quantities and solve the equations simultaneously for the unknowns.  To use equations of motion along vertical motion, take as negative and upward direction as positive.  Be careful on taking reference point (origin of coordinate). Choose the reference point at the position where event initiates or the ground in general.      Relative Velocity Problems: When relative velocities are involved, use the following steps:  List the given quantities in a form of notation that allows you to recognize which object is moving in what reference frame.  Draw a diagram showing the relationship between the vector velocities of the problem.  Write the equations relating the horizontal and vertical components of these vectors.  Solve the equations simultaneously for the unknowns of interest.      "

  "title": "Projtile Motion",
  "body": " Projtile Motion               Projectile is a particle which has both horizontal as well as vertical motions. For example, a baseball in flight is a projectile. To analyze the projectile motion, three basic assumptions are made:  acceleration due to gravity is constant and is directed downward,  the effect of air resistance is negligible, and  the surface of the earth is flat.  To analyze the projectile motion, two‐dimensional motion is separated into vertical and horizontal motions. The object in vertical motion experiences constant acceleration due to gravity. The object in horizontal motion on the other hand experiences no acceleration and hence it maintains a constant horizontal velocity through out its motion. Suppose a particle is thrown from the origin with an initial velocity ( ), along an angle from the ground level as shown in , then the x- and y- components of the initial velocity are given by and The horizontal distance covered by the projectile in any time is given by The vertical distance covered by the projectile in any time is given by here is taken as positive for downward direction. Hence velocities and angle of a projectile after time is given by  and   The time taken by the projectile to reach its highest point, and falls to the ground again is called a time of flight . The time for the projectile to reach the ground from its highest point is equal to the time of fall for a freely falling object that falls straight down from the same height. This is because an object in flight only experiences vertical force (weight of the object) in vertical motion but not in horizontal motion as soon as it is released from the thrower's hand. Projectile paths are parabolic and, therefore, symmetric. The object reaches the top of its rise in half of the total time of flight . At the top of the rise, the vertical velocity is zero. These facts can be used to derive the horizontal distance traveled by the projectile, also called the range . At maximum height, and ; therefore, the time of flight using eqns. and   and the range, can be calculated using eqns. , , and , or,  The maximum height is given by   If , then is maximum using eqn. . sketches the trajectories of projectiles thrown with the same initial speed at different angles of inclination. The trajectory of a projectile is parabolic in nature as can be seen from eqns. and ,   which resembles the parabolic equation .  "

  "title": "Circular Kinematics",
  "body": " Circular Kinematics       An object moving in a circular path is called a circular motion. In a uniform circular motion the direction of velocity is constantly changing but its magnitude remains constant. This constantly changing velocity vector produces the acceleration on an object which is pointed towards the center of a circle, called a centripetal acceleration. For this acceleration to happen there must exists a resultant force which is called the centripetal force. The centripetal force is not a physical force like frictional force, normal force, or gravity force, etc. it does not act on a body but it makes the body to rotate in a circle. This is a resulting force rather than a causing force like tension in a string, normal force acting on a body, frictional force between the surfaces of contact, and all fundamental forces. It is an unbalanced force. [ Note that the causing force always comes in pair.] If is the radius of the path, and is the time period, the time it takes to complete a circle, then its speed (linear) is given by For a uniform circular motion centripetal acceleration , is pointed along the radial direction towards its center and the tangential acceleration is zero. For a non-uniform circular motion there is still a radial acceleration but the tangential acceleration is non-zero pointed along the direction of velocity. If the centripetal force vanishes, the object flies off at a tangent to the circle.    Centripetal Acceleration:                   Consider a particle rotating in a circular path and reaches to point A from point B in a small time interval . The velocity vectors of the particle are at point A and at point B. The angular displacement subtends by the particle between point A and B is as shown in .  From quadrilateral OAMB of , and hence, as . Now from radian formula, Dividing both sides by , we get-  From , also, Dividing both sides by , we get-   using eqn. where , is a centripetal acceleration. In uniform circular motion is called the radial acceleration. In non-uniform circular motion the magnitude of a linear velocity is changing with time, and hence there is another acceleration presents along the tangential direction of motion, also called tangential acceleration. Which can be obtained by differentiating eqn. w.r.t. 't',  Hence the resultant acceleration in non-uniform circular motion [ ] is given by     Angular Displacement, :  The angle subtends by an object when rotating in a circular path about an axis is called the angular displacement. In a 2D space, angular displacement describes a rotation of an object and is a simply number, a scalar. However, in 3D space, direction of the axis of rotation of an object need to be specified and hence it behaves as a vector. The direction of the vector is the direction of the axis of rotation, and the magnitude is how big the rotation was. Since angular displacement does not follow all the vectors rule in 2 dimension hence it is not taken as a vector quantity. For angular rotation in 2D, , i.e. not commutative for large angles. Suppose you have two pencils parallel to each other facing tips opposite to you. You rotate first pencil to about vertical axis so that tip facing left side, then rotate it again by about a horizontal axis so that its tip facing upward. Now rotate the second pencil by about the horizontal axis so that its tip facing upward and again rotate it by about a another horizontal axis so that tip facing left. Now you can see that they have different orientations, not parallel any more.    Angular Velocity, :  The angular velocity, of an object is defined as the rate of change of angular displacement, . That is, . It is measured in unit ( ). It is a vector quantity and its direction is along the direction of axis of rotation defined by right hand thumb rule. If fingers of right hand are curled in the direction of rotation of the body then thumb pointed along the direction of angular velocity. The average angular velocity is given by and the instantaneous angular velocity is given by     Angular Frequency, :  It is also known as circular frequency which measures angular displacement per unit time. Its unit is therefore radians per second. It is a scalar quantity. It is related to angular velocity in the same way as circular motion is related to simple harmonic motion. If an object goes around a circle path once in a certain time T (in seconds), then it has subtended radians angle, and its angular velocity is thus radians per second. , frequency and hence the angular frequency.    Angular Acceleration, :  It is the rate of change of angular velocity. The average angular acceleration is given by and the instantaneous angular acceleration is given by       Equations of motion in a circular motion:      "

  "body": " Fundamental and Mechanical Forces    There are four fundamental forces in nature: gravitational, electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear. Gravitational force is the weakest known forces in nature. It is a long range force. It exists due to mass of the objects. Electromagnetic force is also a long range force and is stronger than gravitational force. It exists due to charges of the objects. Strong nuclear force is the strongest known force but it is the shortest range force which only exists inside the nucleus. Its main job is to hold subatomic particles of the nucleus together. (i.e. binding the positively charged protons and neutral neutrons inside the nucleus). Weak nuclear force is weaker than strong nuclear force and electromagnetic force. It is also a very short range force and accounts for the radioactivity in unstable nuclei.    For a large-scale, electrically neutral objects such as those encountered in this course, the only force that acts at a distance is the gravitational force. All other forces we encounter will be contact forces (mechanical forces) that occur at the boundary of an object where that object physically touches some other object, e.g. tension, friction, normal, and other applied forces [ ]. Actually, mechanical force, or chemical force, or any other kinds of force are all electromagnetic forces. In our daily life almost all force we experienced are electromagnetic force except the force of gravity. Strong nuclear forces are very short range and we do not feel them dispite the fact that it is more powerful than the electromagnetic force. Weak forces are also short range and even weaker than electromagnetic force. mechanical forces     To identify forces acting on a body, first identify the boundary of that object and include the weight of everything inside that boundary. Then identify everything that touches the boundary from outside the object and include an appropriate force for each point of contact.    Look at the forces in .

  "title": "Newton’s Laws of Motion",
  "body": " Newton's Laws of Motion    Newton's first law provides the definition of force which states that every object in a state of rest remains at rest or in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in that motion along the same direction, unless an external force is applied onto it. Force is not required to continue the motion of anything which is already in motion.  The first law is also called a law of inertia. Inertia is an ability of an object to resist changes in its motion. In other words, we can say the laziness of an object to change its mechanical state is called an inertia. Mass is related to inertia, the bigger the mass the more difficult it is to change its state of rest or motion.    Newton's second law provides the measurement of force which states that the rate of change of momentum is directly proportional to the applied force and its direction is along that change.      Newton's third law provides the property of force which states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Meaning, force always comes in pair. If an object applies the action force on object then the object applies the reaction force on the object . These pair of forces always act on two different objects. For example, if action force is acting on object B then reaction force must be acting on the object A.   If you stand on a weighing scale, your weight push the scale down with a force equal to your weight, then the scale applies the reaction force on you equal to your weight as a normal force. Remember that even if weight and normal force are equal they are not always equal and they are completely different forces. You get a normal force only when you are in contact with the other surface but you have the weight even if you are above the surface (while jumping) of anything. Suppose you are pushing the book against a wall, so that it does not fall. In that case, the book pushes against the wall and the wall pushes back. This interaction is the normal force and acts on both the book and the wall. None of these forces were equal to the gravitational force or weight of the book.    "

  "title": "Friction",
  "body": " Friction  Friction is a resistive force that opposes or tends to oppose relative motion between two objects. It is a force that exists between the surfaces of contact of the two objects [ ]. If two systems are in contact and stationary relative to each other, then the friction between them is called static friction . This force arises from mechanical interlocking at the microscopic level plus the electrostatic molecular forces that hold the surfaces themselves together. If two systems are in contact and moving relative to one another, then the friction between them is called kinetic friction . This force arises from forming and breaking of microscopic adhesive bonds between atoms on the surfaces plus some mechanical linkage between the small irregularities on the surfaces as shown in . Experimentally it is found that frictional force is proportional to normal force, i.e., as shown in .                    Where proportionality constant is called coefficient of friction. It defines the nature of roughness of the surfaces being in contact. It is a dimensional less quantity. The coefficient of friction is a property of materials and does not change with the angle. For static friction, N. The symbol implies that static friction can have a maximum value of . Static friction is a responsive force that increases to be equal and opposite to whatever force is being exerted, up to its maximum limit. Once the applied force exceeds , the object moves. Thus, . For kinetic friction, . Remember the direction of friction is always opposite to the direction of motion or applied force, not in the direction of normal. Hence the above equations has no vector form.  Friction decreases with increase in smoothness of the surfaces of contact as decreases, but if the surfaces are ultra smooth then friction increases because of inter molecular forces starts to act between the two surfaces as they come very close to each other, due to which it becomes harder to make them slide on each other. Friction is a complex force, and its behavior is still not completely understood. On molecular level friction has no existence. In microscopic level most surfaces look very rough as shown in . Thus, when an object is pushed to move it must raise the object until it can skip the tips of the surface hitting, breaking off the points, or both. A considerable force can be resisted by friction with no apparent motion. Part of the friction is due to adhesive forces between he surface molecules of the two objects, which explains the dependence of friction on the nature of the substances. For example, rubber-soled shoes slip less than those with leather soles. Adhesion varies with substances in contact. Once an object is moving, there are fewer points of contact so less force is required to keep the object moving. At small but nonzero speeds, friction is nearly independent of speed.      When an object is placed on the surface of an inclined plane and the angle of inclination is being increased slowly then at a particular angle the object just begins to slide, this angle is known an angle of repose, . At the angle of repose static frictional force is balanced by one of the components of weight of the object (see in section statics).    Force of Gravity: This force is acting on any object due to attraction of earth. Near the surface of the earth force of gravity is given by its weight, i.e., . Where is the acceleration due to gravity and the direction force is acting along the center of the earth. Normal:  normal This is a force of reaction from the surface where the object is placed. It is always perpendicular to the surface of contact. Tension:  tension This force is acting between two objects on opposite ends of the string, in the directions to taut string at the points of contact. This force stretches the string along fixed support. It is a pulling force. Spring force: A spring is a special medium that has ability to restore its shape, if deformed. All materials have elastic property which helps them to restore their shape, if an applied deforming force has been released. From Hook's law a material (spring) exerts a restoring force that is proportional to a deforming force in opposite direction in which it is stretched or compressed. In mathematical form, The proportionality constant is a measure of the spring's stiffness, also called an elastic constant. The line of action of this force is parallel to the spring axis, and acts along the opposite direction of the displacement vector. The displacement must be measured from the relaxed (equilibrium) position; when the spring is relaxed.  "

As the speed of vehicle increases, the centripetal force needed for circular motion of the vehicle also increases. On the level road the frictional force between tire and the road provides the necessary centripetal force but as the speed increases this friction is not sufficient enough to provide required centripetal force which results in skid the vehicle off the road in opposite direction of the curve. To avoid such calamity the road is banked so that tire has protection from skidding upward. Due to banking necessary centripetal force is provided by the components of frictional force and normal force. Since the frictional force acts on a running tire and road is static in nature (unless it skids), it is directed towards upper edge of the slanted road if the car is running with low velocity or at rest. However the frictional force acts towards lower edge of road if the car has high velocity because the car has tendency to skid towards upper edge of the road.   "

  "body": " Center of Mass   The center of mass of a system of particles is a point in space at which the net mass of the system seems to be located. It is the mean position of the mass of a system or a body. Center of gravity is an imaginary point in a body where the entire weight of the body may be assumed to be concentrated or it is a point at which the gravity appears to act. In a uniform gravitational field the center of gravity is identical to the center of mass, but they do not coincide in a non-uniform gravitational field. Imagine that you are lying horizontally in space above the planet where you are experiencing a greater gravitational field strength towards your head than towards your feet, then your center of gravity is located somewhere near your shoulder rather than your belly button (i.e. navel or your center of mass). The center of gravity (or center of mass) may coincide with a geometric center of the body if it has a uniform mass distribution and possess symmetrical shape. An asymmetrical object composed of a variety of materials with different masses, however, has a center of gravity located at some distance from its geometric center. In some cases, such as hollow bodies or irregularly shaped objects, the center of gravity (or center of mass) may occur in space at a point external to the physical material. For example, the center of mass of binary stars lies between the stars and in the center of a tennis ball.      The center of (mass) gravity (point ) of any body can be determined by suspending the body by a cord attached at point and then by a cord attached at . When the body is suspended from , the line is vertical; when it is suspended from , the line is vertical. The center of gravity is at the intersection of and [ ]. When an object is suspended from any single point, its center of gravity lies directly beneath that point. For a group of discrete masses the location of center of mass can be defined as: Vector position of center of mass.  or, or equivalently      Problem Solving Technique: To determine the center of mass of a uniformly distributed body, one performs the following steps:  Break the body down into its constituent parts.  Specify the length, area, or volume of each constituent part.  Locate the coordinates of the center of mass of each constituent part.  Utilize the equations shown above using length, area, or volume in place of the mass. for a unifrom sheet  If an object has a uniform mass distribution (uniform density), then its geometric center is taken as center of mass.
