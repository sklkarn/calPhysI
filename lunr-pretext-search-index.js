  "body": " General physics is a calculus-based introductory physics book. This book is a concise form of my lecture notes that I have been delivering in my introductory level physics courses for many years. This text is not a replacement of any textbook that has been recommended by the instructor but designed to provide additional materials as my personal teaching activities in calculus-based physics. It is intended to support introductory level materials at a rapid and an efficient way. Students who want to use this text assume to have a prerequisite knowledge of some basic mathematical skills such as geometry, algebra, trigonometry, and some advanced mathematical tools such as a differential and integral calculus.  Learning skills by memorization that have been built in many students as a regular practice, cannot work efficiently in learning physics. Physics is a logical and conceptual based learning hence it requires a completely different pattern of study than simply trying to memorize lists of formulae or examples. This book is organized into two volumes that covers the syllabus of introductory physics at undergraduate level in various universities and colleges. General Physics I contains Basics of Mechanics, Fluid Mechanics, and Thermodynamics.  General Physics II contains Electricity, Magnetism, Waves, Acoustics, and Optics. These topics have been carefully chosen to provide an introduction to the basic concepts in physics and to give an opportunity to sharpen critical thinking and problem solving skills. The main objective of this book is to learn how to investigate and approach problems in a logical manner. This book strives to guide readers to learn physics in a logical manner. Many examples and practice problems throughout the text may be helpful to refine physical intuition.  To tackle the physical problems the book uses the 'GUESS' strategy for a systematic gatheing of information and finding realistic and logistic solution. Here is what GUESS stands for.   G: Given, identify the given information and sketch the information if possible.   U: Unknown, identify the unknown that we are looking for.   E: Equation\/s, set up the equation from given information.   S: Substitute, substitute the number\/s in the equation\/s.   S: Solve, solve the equation to obtain the answer.  Comments and suggestions for improvements to the text will be gratefully accepted. -- Author   "

  "title": "Derived Units",
  "body": " Derived Units   Derived units are the unit of such physical quantities which depends on the base physical quantities via a mathematical relation between them. Some of the derived units are expressed below.     Area =   i.e. in SI system, in CGS system, and in FPS system.     Density =   i.e. in SI system, in CGS system, and in FPS system, (lb stands for pound).     Speed =   i.e. in SI system, in CGS system, and in FPS system.     Electric resistance =   i.e. in SI system.     Magnetic flux =electric potential   i.e. or wb (weber) in SI system.      Dimensional Analysis  We can express the derived physical quantity by the dimensions of the base quantities. The dimensions of mass, length, and time are written as [M], [L], and [T], respectively. The square brackets round the letter represent dimensions of a base quantity. The dimensions of any other quantity will involve one or more of these basic dimensions. For example, the volume occupied by an object can be expressed as a product of length, breadth, and height, hence the dimensions of volume are . Similarly, velocity is a distance divided by a time, and hence the dimensions of velocity are . The dimensional equations of speed [v], force [F] and mass density can be expressed as , , and .  Dimensional analysis is a method in which the relationship between different physical quantities (or units) can be analyzed by identifying their base quantities (or units). Dimensional analysis helps convert the units of one system into another system or helps check the resulting formula in a physical process. Some quantities have no dimensions and they are called dimensionless quantities, e.g. the ratio of two lengths are dimensionless. The dimensional consistency does not guarantee the correctness of equations. It is uncertain to the extent of dimensionless quantities or functions. Dimensional analysis is based on the principle of homogeneity which states that the dimensions of both sides of an equation are same. For example, in the equation below dimension on left is equal to dimension on right.   To verify that let us use the principle of homogeneity, i.e., which implies that both sides of the equation has the same dimension, hence this equation is a dimensionally correct. It must be noted that a dimensionally correct equation need not be an exact (correct) equation, but a dimensionally wrong (incorrect) equation must be wrong.  Use principle of homogeneity to find the time period of the oscillation of a simple pendulum which is dependent on its mass, length, and the acceleration due to gravity. principle of homogenity From the given information, we have - or, [where K is a dimensionless quantity] Equating the power on both sides of the dimensional equation, we get - and    Some derived units are summarized in the table 1.2.

  "title": "Errors in Measurement",
  "body": " Errors in Measurement  Measurement is a base of science. In every measurement there is some uncertainty. This uncertainty is called an error. The concept of errors can be understood by knowing the terms accuracy and precision. Accuracy refers to how closely a measured value agrees with the correct (true) value. Precision refers to how closely individual measurements agree with each other. For example, suppose the true value of a certain length is near 5.678 cm. In one experiment, the measured value is found to be 5.5 cm by using a measuring instrument of resolution 0.1 cm, while in another experiment, the length is determined to be 5.38 cm by using a measuring device of greater resolution, say 0.01 cm. The first measurement is more accurate (as it is closer to the true value) but less precise (as its resolution is only 0.1 cm), while the second measurement is less accurate but more precise. Thus every measurement is approximate due to errors in measurement. In general, the errors can be classified as (a) systematic errors and (b) random errors. The errors that appear due to faulty instruments or imperfact instrumental design are known as systematic errors. It is a repeatable error in the measurement. The systematic errors are     Instrumental errors: These errors arise due to imperfact calibration or design of the measuring instrument. Usually they are called a Zero Error . It is either a positive or a negative type. These errors can be removed by correcting the measuring device, e.g., in vernier calipers the zero mark of vernier scale may not coincide with the zero mark of the main scale.     Personal errors: They arise due to wrong observations, an individual's bias, lack of proper setting of the apparatus, e.g., parallax error, a person viewing a car's speedometer from the driver's seat will get an accurate reading because she has a direct line of sight. A person viewing the speedometer from the passenger seat will overestimate the reading because of the viewing angle between his eye, the meter, and the arrow.    The errors that appear due to system noise or disturbance of measuring location are known as random errors. It is a unpredictable and non-repeatable. Experimental error is one of the random errors. Experimental errors arise due to some external conditions of the instrument such as pressure, temperature, humidity, or magnetic fields, e.g., a thermometer placed under the armpit will always give a temperature lower than the actual value of the body temperature. This type of errors may also occur due to random and unpredictable fluctuations in experimental conditions (e.g. variation in temperature, supply voltage, local atmospheric pressure, etc) and personal errors (e.g., change in readings if the observer repeats the same observation).

  "title": "Significant Figures",
  "body": " Significant Figures   Significant figures are the digits which give us useful information about the accuracy of a measurement. The result of a measurement includes digits that are known reliably and the last digit that is uncertain. For example, the length of an object measured to be cm when measured with a meterstick marked with centimeter (0.1 resolution) and has four significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7 are certain while the last digit 5 is uncertain. If someone measure the same object with another meterstick marked with millimeters (0.01 resolution) one could have measured the length to be 287.54 cm and that contains 5 significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7, and 5 are certain while the last digit 4 is uncertain. Each smaller measurement allows observers to determine the length of the object with a bit more accuracy. Maybe someother can measure with great accuracy as 287.542 cm. No matter what you do, there must be some inaccuracy always come at every measurement. Scientists account for this unavoidable uncertainty in measurement by using significant digits. significant digits do not remove the uncertainty but warn readers to where uncertainty lies.   has one significant digit: only 1 is interesting and reliable. The zeroes may have been just the placeholders; they may have rounded something off to get this value.  1000.0 has five significant digits: the \".0\" tells us about the accuracy of the measurement that the measurement is accurate to the tenths place.  In scientific notation if 200 has two significant figures then is used. If it has three sig.fig. then is used. If it had four then 200.0 is sufficient.  Here are some basic rules to determine significant figures:    All nonzero digits are significant; in number 0.003004500 the digits 3, 4, and 5 are significant.    All zeroes between significant digits are significant; in number 0.003004500 the 0, 0 between 3 and 4 are significant.    Trailing zeros in the decimal portion are significant; in number 0.003004500 the 0,0 at end of 5 are significant.    Trailing zeroes in a whole number with no decimal shown are not significant; in number \"540\" there are only two sig.fig. 5 and 4, the last 0 is not significant.    Leading zeroes in the decimal portion to the first non-zero digit are not significant; in number 0.003004500 the 0 to the right of decimal point and digits 0, 0 to the left of decimal point before the digit 3 are not significant.    Exponential digits in scientific notation are not significant; has only three significant figures, 1, 3, and 2.      Rounding off the Numbers  When rounding, we examine the digit following to the right of the digit that is to be the last digit in the rounded off number. The digit we are examining is the first digit to be dropped.  If digit to be dropped off is less than 5, then drop it off with all the other digits to the right of it.  If the digit to be dropped off is greater than 5, then increase the number by 1 to the preceeding digit to be rounded.  If the digit to be dropped is 5, then round the preceeding digit so that it will become even number. Zero is considered to be even when rounding off. This is the process of minimizing systematic error. Here are some examples:    Round 742,396 to four, three, and two significant digits: To round to four sig. fig. start with the first significant digit, which is the 7. Then count to the right from there. The first four significant digits of 742,396 are the 7, the 4, the 2, and the 3. Just to the right of the 3 is a 9. Because this value is \"greater than 5\", round the 3 up to 4. Replace the remaining digits (the 9 and the 6) with zeroes. Then: 742,400 (four significant digits).  To round 742,396 to three places, start again with the 7 and include the next two digits, being the 4 and the 2. Since the next digit is a 3, which is \"less than 5\", leave the 2 alone and don't round up. Replace the three digits after the comma with zeroes. Then: 742,000 (three significant digits).  To round 742,396 to two places, use only the first two digits, which are followed by a 2, so don't round up. Instead, just replace the final four digits with zeroes, to get: 740,000 (two significant digits).    Round 0.07284 to four, three, and two significant digits: To round 0.07284 to four significant digits, start with the first significant digit, which is the 7. (The zero between the decimal point and the 7 is not significant, as it serves only to \"place\" the 7 into the hundreds place.) There are only three more digits, so all of them will be included in answer. Since no digit follows the 4, there is no information about rounding, so just leave the 4 as it is. Hence, 0.07284 is four sig-digs.  When rounding 0.07284 to three sig-digs, the final sig-dig is the 8, which is followed by the 4. Since 4 is less than 5, so simply drop it. Because these sig-digs are after the decimal point, not replace the 4 with a zero. Hence, 0.0728 is three sig-digs.  To round 0.07284 to two sig-digs, use the 7 and the 2. Since the 2 is followed by an 8, round the 2 up to 3; drop everything that follows. Hence, 0.073 is two sig-digs.    Round 425.35 to four and two significant digits: For four sig.fig. this number is 425.4, because the value to be rounded off (3) is \"odd\" and followed by a \"5\", then round the 3 up to 4 and remove the remaining digits. For two sig.fig. it would be 420, because the value to be rounded off (2) is \"even\" and followed by a \"5\", then leave 2 as it is and replace the other with zeroes.      Mathematical Operations with Significant Figures     Addition or subtraction: The final result should retain as many decimal places as there are in the number with the least decimal places in the data. For example, the sum of the numbers 436.32 g, 227.2 g and 0.301 g is 663.821 g by mere arithmetic addition but the least precise measurement (227.2 g) is correct to only one decimal place. Therefore, the final result should be rounded off to 663.8 g. Similarly, the difference in lengths of 66.25 m and 23.3055 m is . Which can be expressed as 42.94 only.     Multiplication or division: The final result should retain as many significant figures as are there in the original number with the least significant figures. For example, if mass of an object is measured to be, say, 4.237 g (four significant figures) and its volume is measured to be , then its density, by mere arithmetic division, is 1.68804780876 upto 11 decimal places. But density should be reported to three significant figures.      "

Acceleration relates to velocity in graph in the same manner as velocity relates to position in graph . Curvature in position-time graph gives the instantaneous acceleration. Since the slope of the velocity curve, , is the time rate of change of velocity, or which is called the bending function of the position-time curve.    Reading of graph                   The specific features of motions can be read as follows from the graph: If position, x is increasing, then velocity, v is , if position, x is decreasing, then velocity, v is , if velocity, v is increasing, then acceleration, a is , if velocity, v is decreasing, then acceleration, a is . The slope of x t graph gives velocity and the slope of graph gives acceleration. The area under graph gives position [ ] and the area under graph gives velocity [ ]. Note that even if the shape of these graphs look weird all the motions happen only in one dimension, i.e., going up or down with time .  From , slope of line AB=+ve, slope of line BC=0, and slope of line CD =-ve, which means the object is running with constant velocity along +ve direction, stays at rest, and again starts moving with constant velocity along -ve direction, respectively. The slope of bottom portion of curve DE =0 nd that at top portion is +ve hence the object is speeding up in +ve direction. The slope of bottom portion of curve EF =+ve and that at top portion =0, hence the object is slowing down in +ve direction. The slope of top portion of curve FG =0 and that at bottom portion is -ve, hence the object is speeding up in -ve direction. The slope of top portion of curve GH =-ve and that at bottom portion =0, hence the object is slowing down in -ve direction as can be verified in figure . If velocity is constant there is no acceleration and if velocity is increasing in +ve direction, acceleration is +ve, if velocity is decreasing in +ve direction, acceleration is -ve, if velocity is increasing in -ve direction, acceleration is -ve, if velocity is decreasing in -ve direction, acceleration is +ve as can be seen from graph .

  "body": " Rules to follow while solving motion problems:     Linear Motion Problems: When motion problems become complex (say, more than one object involved, or a single object experiences complex motion) one must subdivide the problem into several sub-problems according to the following steps:  Draw pictures of the situation at the critical times denoting when one sub-problem begins and another ends. Label the drawings appropriately, indicating the positions, velocities, accelerations, and times involved. Use subscripts to distinguish the variables in one sub-problem from another.  Write the appropriate equations for each sub-problem.  Write the equations that relate one sub-problem with the others.  List the given quantities and solve the equations simultaneously for the unknowns.  To use equations of motion along vertical motion, take as negative and upward direction as positive.  Be careful on taking reference point (origin of coordinate). Choose the reference point at the position where event initiates or the ground in general.      Relative Velocity Problems: When relative velocities are involved, use the following steps:  List the given quantities in a form of notation that allows you to recognize which object is moving in what reference frame.  Draw a diagram showing the relationship between the vector velocities of the problem.  Write the equations relating the horizontal and vertical components of these vectors.  Solve the equations simultaneously for the unknowns of interest.      "

  "body": " Projtile Motion               Projectile is a particle which has both horizontal as well as vertical motions. For example, a baseball in flight is a projectile. To analyze the projectile motion, three basic assumptions are made:  acceleration due to gravity is constant and is directed downward,  the effect of air resistance is negligible, and  the surface of the earth is flat.  To analyze the projectile motion, two‐dimensional motion is separated into vertical and horizontal motions. The object in vertical motion experiences constant acceleration due to gravity. The object in horizontal motion on the other hand experiences no acceleration and hence it maintains a constant horizontal velocity through out its motion. Suppose a particle is thrown from the origin with an initial velocity ( ), along an angle from the ground level as shown in , then the x- and y- components of the initial velocity are given by and The horizontal distance covered by the projectile in any time is given by The vertical distance covered by the projectile in any time is given by here is taken as positive for downward direction. Hence velocities and angle of a projectile after time is given by  and   The time taken by the projectile to reach its highest point, and falls to the ground again is called a time of flight . The time for the projectile to reach the ground from its highest point is equal to the time of fall for a freely falling object that falls straight down from the same height. This is because an object in flight only experiences vertical force (weight of the object) in vertical motion but not in horizontal motion as soon as it is released from the thrower's hand. Projectile paths are parabolic and, therefore, symmetric. The object reaches the top of its rise in half of the total time of flight . At the top of the rise, the vertical velocity is zero. These facts can be used to derive the horizontal distance traveled by the projectile, also called the range . At maximum height, and ; therefore, the time of flight using eqns. and   and the range, can be calculated using eqns. , , and , or,  The maximum height is given by   If , then is maximum using eqn. . sketches the trajectories of projectiles thrown with the same initial speed at different angles of inclination.

  "body": " Circular Kinematics       An object moving in a circular path is called a circular motion. In a uniform circular motion the direction of velocity is constantly changing but its magnitude remains constant. This constantly changing velocity vector produces the acceleration on an object which is pointed towards the center of a circle, called a centripetal acceleration. For this acceleration to happen there must exists a resultant force which is called the centripetal force. The centripetal force is not a physical force like frictional force, normal force, or gravity force, etc. it does not act on a body but it makes the body to rotate in a circle. This is a resulting force rather than a causing force like tension in a string, normal force acting on a body, frictional force between the surfaces of contact, and all fundamental forces. It is an unbalanced force. [ Note that the causing force always comes in pair.] If is the radius of the path, and is the time period, the time it takes to complete a circle, then its speed (linear) is given by For a uniform circular motion centripetal acceleration , is pointed along the radial direction towards its center and the tangential acceleration is zero. For a non-uniform circular motion there is still a radial acceleration but the tangential acceleration is non-zero pointed along the direction of velocity. If the centripetal force vanishes, the object flies off at a tangent to the circle.    Centripetal Acceleration:                   Consider a particle rotating in a circular path and reaches to point A from point B in a small time interval . The velocity vectors of the particle are at point A and at point B. The angular displacement subtends by the particle between point A and B is as shown in .  From quadrilateral OAMB of , and hence, as . Now from radian formula, Dividing both sides by , we get-  From , also, Dividing both sides by , we get-   using eqn. where , is a centripetal acceleration. In uniform circular motion is called the radial acceleration. In non-uniform circular motion the magnitude of a linear velocity is changing with time, and hence there is another acceleration presents along the tangential direction of motion, also called tangential acceleration. Which can be obtained by differentiating eqn. w.r.t. 't',  Hence the resultant acceleration in non-uniform circular motion [ ] is given by     Angular Displacement, :  The angle subtends by an object when rotating in a circular path about an axis is called the angular displacement. In a 2D space, angular displacement describes a rotation of an object and is a simply number, a scalar. However, in 3D space, direction of the axis of rotation of an object need to be specified and hence it behaves as a vector. The direction of the vector is the direction of the axis of rotation, and the magnitude is how big the rotation was. Since angular displacement does not follow all the vectors rule in 2 dimension hence it is not taken as a vector quantity. For angular rotation in 2D, , i.e. not commutative for large angles. Suppose you have two pencils parallel to each other facing tips opposite to you. You rotate first pencil to about vertical axis so that tip facing left side, then rotate it again by about a horizontal axis so that its tip facing upward. Now rotate the second pencil by about the horizontal axis so that its tip facing upward and again rotate it by about a another horizontal axis so that tip facing left. Now you can see that they have different orientations, not parallel any more.    Angular Velocity, :  The angular velocity, of an object is defined as the rate of change of angular displacement, . That is, . It is measured in unit ( ). It is a vector quantity and its direction is along the direction of axis of rotation defined by right hand thumb rule. If fingers of right hand are curled in the direction of rotation of the body then thumb pointed along the direction of angular velocity. The average angular velocity is given by and the instantaneous angular velocity is given by     Angular Frequency, :  It is also known as circular frequency which measures angular displacement per unit time. Its unit is therefore radians per second. It is a scalar quantity. It is related to angular velocity in the same way as circular motion is related to simple harmonic motion. If an object goes around a circle path once in a certain time T (in seconds), then it has subtended radians angle, and its angular velocity is thus radians per second. , frequency and hence the angular frequency.    Angular Acceleration, :  It is the rate of change of angular velocity. The average angular acceleration is given by and the instantaneous angular acceleration is given by       Equations of motion in a circular motion:      "

  "body": " Fundamental and Mechanical Forces    There are four fundamental forces in nature: gravitational, electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear. Gravitational force is the weakest known forces in nature. It is a long range force. It exists due to mass of the objects. Electromagnetic force is also a long range force and is stronger than gravitational force. It exists due to charges of the objects. Strong nuclear force is the strongest known force but it is the shortest range force which only exists inside the nucleus. Its main job is to hold subatomic particles of the nucleus together. (i.e. binding the positively charged protons and neutral neutrons inside the nucleus). Weak nuclear force is weaker than strong nuclear force and electromagnetic force. It is also a very short range force and accounts for the radioactivity in unstable nuclei.    For a large-scale, electrically neutral objects such as those encountered in this course, the only force that acts at a distance is the gravitational force. All other forces we encounter will be contact forces (mechanical forces) that occur at the boundary of an object where that object physically touches some other object, e.g. tension, friction, normal, and other applied forces [ ]. Actually, mechanical force, or chemical force, or any other kinds of force are all electromagnetic forces. In our daily life almost all force we experienced are electromagnetic force except the force of gravity. Strong nuclear forces are very short range and we do not feel them dispite the fact that it is more powerful than the electromagnetic force. Weak forces are also short range and even weaker than electromagnetic force. mechanical forces     To identify forces acting on a body, first identify the boundary of that object and include the weight of everything inside that boundary. Then identify everything that touches the boundary from outside the object and include an appropriate force for each point of contact.    Look at the forces in .

  "body": " Newton's Laws of Motion    Newton's first law provides the definition of force which states that every object in a state of rest remains at rest or in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in that motion along the same direction, unless an external force is applied onto it. Force is not required to continue the motion of anything which is already in motion.  The first law is also called a law of inertia. Inertia is an ability of an object to resist changes in its motion. In other words, we can say the laziness of an object to change its mechanical state is called an inertia. Mass is related to inertia, the bigger the mass the more difficult it is to change its state of rest or motion.    Newton's second law provides the measurement of force which states that the rate of change of momentum is directly proportional to the applied force and its direction is along that change.      Newton's third law provides the property of force which states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Meaning, force always comes in pair. If an object applies the action force on object then the object applies the reaction force on the object . These pair of forces always act on two different objects. For example, if action force is acting on object B then reaction force must be acting on the object A.   If you stand on a weighing scale, your weight push the scale down with a force equal to your weight, then the scale applies the reaction force on you equal to your weight as a normal force. Remember that even if weight and normal force are equal they are not always equal and they are completely different forces. You get a normal force only when you are in contact with the other surface but you have the weight even if you are above the surface (while jumping) of anything. Suppose you are pushing the book against a wall, so that it does not fall. In that case, the book pushes against the wall and the wall pushes back. This interaction is the normal force and acts on both the book and the wall. None of these forces were equal to the gravitational force or weight of the book.    "

  "title": "Friction",
  "body": " Friction  Friction is a resistive force that opposes or tends to oppose relative motion between two objects. It is a force that exists between the surfaces of contact of the two objects [ ]. If two systems are in contact and stationary relative to each other, then the friction between them is called static friction . This force arises from mechanical interlocking at the microscopic level plus the electrostatic molecular forces that hold the surfaces themselves together. If two systems are in contact and moving relative to one another, then the friction between them is called kinetic friction . This force arises from forming and breaking of microscopic adhesive bonds between atoms on the surfaces plus some mechanical linkage between the small irregularities on the surfaces as shown in . Experimentally it is found that frictional force is proportional to normal force, i.e., as shown in .                    Where proportionality constant is called coefficient of friction. It defines the nature of roughness of the surfaces being in contact. It is a dimensional less quantity. The coefficient of friction is a property of materials and does not change with the angle. For static friction, N. The symbol implies that static friction can have a maximum value of . Static friction is a responsive force that increases to be equal and opposite to whatever force is being exerted, up to its maximum limit. Once the applied force exceeds , the object moves. Thus, . For kinetic friction, . Remember the direction of friction is always opposite to the direction of motion or applied force, not in the direction of normal. Hence the above equations has no vector form.  Friction decreases with increase in smoothness of the surfaces of contact as decreases, but if the surfaces are ultra smooth then friction increases because of inter molecular forces starts to act between the two surfaces as they come very close to each other, due to which it becomes harder to make them slide on each other. Friction is a complex force, and its behavior is still not completely understood. On molecular level friction has no existence. In microscopic level most surfaces look very rough as shown in . Thus, when an object is pushed to move it must raise the object until it can skip the tips of the surface hitting, breaking off the points, or both. A considerable force can be resisted by friction with no apparent motion. Part of the friction is due to adhesive forces between he surface molecules of the two objects, which explains the dependence of friction on the nature of the substances. For example, rubber-soled shoes slip less than those with leather soles. Adhesion varies with substances in contact. Once an object is moving, there are fewer points of contact so less force is required to keep the object moving. At small but nonzero speeds, friction is nearly independent of speed.      When an object is placed on the surface of an inclined plane and the angle of inclination is being increased slowly then at a particular angle the object just begins to slide, this angle is known an angle of repose, . At the angle of repose static frictional force is balanced by one of the components of weight of the object (see in section statics).    Force of Gravity: This force is acting on any object due to attraction of earth. Near the surface of the earth force of gravity is given by its weight, i.e., . Where is the acceleration due to gravity and the direction force is acting along the center of the earth. Normal:  normal This is a force of reaction from the surface where the object is placed. It is always perpendicular to the surface of contact. Tension:  tension This force is acting between two objects on opposite ends of the string, in the directions to taut string at the points of contact. This force stretches the string along fixed support. It is a pulling force. Spring force: A spring is a special medium that has ability to restore its shape, if deformed. All materials have elastic property which helps them to restore their shape, if an applied deforming force has been released. From Hook's law a material (spring) exerts a restoring force that is proportional to a deforming force in opposite direction in which it is stretched or compressed. In mathematical form, The proportionality constant is a measure of the spring's stiffness, also called an elastic constant. The line of action of this force is parallel to the spring axis, and acts along the opposite direction of the displacement vector. The displacement must be measured from the relaxed (equilibrium) position; when the spring is relaxed.  "

  "body": " Statics   When more than one force acts on a body in such a way that their net effects become zero is called an equilibrium. Equilibrium refers to a state of balance. An object is considered to be in a state of equilibrium when two opposing forces acting on the object balance each other. There may be two possible cases for a body in equilibrium,   Static Equilibrium: sum of all forces, i.e., and net torques i.e.,    Translational Equilibrium: sum of all forces, , i.e., .   Rotational Equilibrium: sum of all torques about a point on an object, . (i.e., )   torque        Static Equilibrium  A system is in static equilibrium whenever no part of the system is moving. An example of static equilibrium is a spider web suspending one or more bugs. Any segment of the web (any bug, any strand, any junction, or any combination thereof) may be treated as a body.    The vector sum of the forces acting on an object in static equilibrium is equal to zero. which is described by Newton First law or, equivalently  In static equilibrium, the total force acting on a body, , and also the velocity of a body .     Problem Solving Technique: To solve a static equilibrium problem one needs to:   Read problem, list given quantities, draw a figure of the physical situation, and label the forces involved.    Draw force diagrams (free-body diagrams) for each body in equilibrium.    Resolve the forces into components.    Sum the x- and y-components of forces and set them to zero.

As the speed of vehicle increases, the centripetal force needed for circular motion of the vehicle also increases. On the level road the frictional force between tire and the road provides the necessary centripetal force but as the speed increases this friction is not sufficient enough to provide required centripetal force which results in skid the vehicle off the road in opposite direction of the curve. To avoid such calamity the road is banked so that tire has protection from skidding upward. Due to banking necessary centripetal force is provided by the components of frictional force and normal force. Since the frictional force acts on a running tire and road is static in nature (unless it skids), it is directed towards upper edge of the slanted road if the car is running with low velocity or at rest. However the frictional force acts towards lower edge of road if the car has high velocity because the car has tendency to skid towards upper edge of the road.   "

  "title": "Center of Mass",
  "body": " Center of Mass   The center of mass of a system of particles is a point in space at which the net mass of the system seems to be located. It is the mean position of the mass of a system or a body. Center of gravity is an imaginary point in a body where the entire weight of the body may be assumed to be concentrated or it is a point at which the gravity appears to act. In a uniform gravitational field the center of gravity is identical to the center of mass, but they do not coincide in a non-uniform gravitational field. Imagine that you are lying horizontally in space above the planet where you are experiencing a greater gravitational field strength towards your head than towards your feet, then your center of gravity is located somewhere near your shoulder rather than your belly button (i.e. navel or your center of mass). The center of gravity (or center of mass) may coincide with a geometric center of the body if it has a uniform mass distribution and possess symmetrical shape. An asymmetrical object composed of a variety of materials with different masses, however, has a center of gravity located at some distance from its geometric center. In some cases, such as hollow bodies or irregularly shaped objects, the center of gravity (or center of mass) may occur in space at a point external to the physical material. For example, the center of mass of binary stars lies between the stars and in the center of a tennis ball.      The center of (mass) gravity (point ) of any body can be determined by suspending the body by a cord attached at point and then by a cord attached at . When the body is suspended from , the line is vertical; when it is suspended from , the line is vertical. The center of gravity is at the intersection of and [ ]. When an object is suspended from any single point, its center of gravity lies directly beneath that point. For a group of discrete masses the location of center of mass can be defined as: Vector position of center of mass.  or, or equivalently      Problem Solving Technique: To determine the center of mass of a uniformly distributed body, one performs the following steps:  Break the body down into its constituent parts.  Specify the length, area, or volume of each constituent part.  Locate the coordinates of the center of mass of each constituent part.  Utilize the equations shown above using length, area, or volume in place of the mass. for a unifrom sheet  If an object has a uniform mass distribution (uniform density), then its geometric center is taken as center of mass.

  "title": "States of Equilibrium",
  "body": " States of Equilibrium  There are three states of equilibrium:                      Stable equilibrium: The body is said to be in stable equilibrium if its center of gravity lies below lowest possible position. A funnel standing vertically on its base on the table is in stable equilibrium [ ]. If the funnel is tilted a little bit against any side and then allowed to fall, it will come back to its original position. When the funnel is tilted against any side its center of gravity is raised [ ]. The line of action of weight passes through the base of the funnel. As long as the line of action of weight remains inside the base area funnel will come back to the original position. A torque due to weight of the funnel brings it back to the original position. For the funnel to tip over the line of action of the weight arrow will have to form a clockwise moment (or to pass outside the point of support). The funnel needs to have been pushed a lot for tip over. Some examples of stable equilibrium are bodies lying on the floor such as chair, table, book, etc. If a system in stable equilibrium is disturbed slightly, it oscillates around that state first but eventually settles down in exactly the same position as it started [ ]. It does this because its center of gravity is already at the lowest possible position.                      Unstable equilibrium: The body is said to be in unstable equilibrium if the center of gravity of a body lies above the highest possible position. A funnel standing vertically on its stem on the table [ ] is in unstable equilibrium. If the funnel standing vertically is slightly disturbed from its position it will not come back to its original position rather fall down on the surface of table. when the funnel is slightly disturbed its center of gravity is lowered [ ]. The line of action of its weight lies outside the base of stem. The torque due to weight of the rod toppled it down. Other examples of unstable equilibrium are vertically standing cylinder and pencil etc. An unstable system moves away from its original equilibrium state when disturbed. It wants to move away from the original position as soon as it has been disturbed [ ]. It does this because its center of gravity is higher in this state and when disturbed the center of gravity continues to move to a lower position (a more stable one).                      Natural equilibrium: The body is said to be in natural (neutral) equilibrium if the center of gravity of a body is at optimal position it is neither lowered nor is raised up. The object with lower center of gravity is more stable than the one with the higher center of gravity. A funnel lying horizontally on its side at rest on the surface of a table [ ] is in natural equilibrium. If a funnel is pushed slightly to roll, it will neither come back to its original position nor it will roll forward rather it will remain at rest. If the funnel is rolled, its center of gravity is neither raised nor lowered [ ]. This means that its center of gravity is at the same height as before. A neutral system is one where the center of gravity of the system is always at the same level. If it has been disturbed slightly it will therefore settle in the new position without a need to move further on or to move back [ ]. For example, a rolling ball lying on the table.    "

If a force displaces a body to a distance along the direction of force then work can be calculated by . Work is a scalar quantity as it is a measure of transfer of energy from one object to another. The physical quantities which can be obtained by dot product of two vectors are scalar. The unit of work is joule in SI system, ; in FPS system, ft-lb = foot.pound; and in CGS system, erg = dyne.cm.               Suppose a block of mass is displaced to a distance along the horizontal direction by the application of force [ ]. If the force is acting along a direction to the horizontal, then work done by the force is given by The work done by a force is defined as the product of component of the force in the direction of displacement and the magnitude of displacement. Work in physics is different than our daily life work. Suppose you are pushing a rigid brick wall very hard, after some time you get exhausted because you lose your body energy. In our daily life we called this action as a work, but in physics this is not a work because the object did not displace from its position. Hence in physics, whether the force or the displacement is zero, there is no work. Depending upon the angle between the applied force and the displacement, work could be negative, positive, or zero. For example, work done by a frictional force, or work done by a force acting opposite to the motion of object, work done by a force acting parallel to the motion of object, and work done by a force acting perpendicular to the motion of object,   If a force displaces an object to a small distance where then work done by this force is given by If then   The terms like are area under the curve [ ].

  "body": " Energy   The capacity of doing work is known as energy. It is a scalar quantity and it's unit in SI system is Joule. Energy exists in many different forms, such as thermal energy, sound energy, electrical energy, magnetic energy, gravitational energy, chemical energy, mechanical energy, etc. The energy associated with the motion and position of an object is termed as mechanical energy. We focus our understanding here in mechanical energy. Mechanical energy is of two types, kinetic energy and potential energy. The kinetic energy is associated with the motion of the object and potential energy is associated with the position of the object with respect to some other object. For example: elastic potential energy due to a spring force, gravitational potential energy due to gravity, etc. The sum of kinetic and potential energy gives the total mechanical energy of the object.    Work-Energy Theorem  From equations of motion, we have where , , and are final velocity, initial velocity, acceleration, and distance covered by the particle, respectively. From Newton's second law of motion, we have - From eqns. and , we have -  Here the term is called final kinetic energy, , the term is called initial kinetic energy, , and the term is work done by a force. Hence, Which is known as work-energy theorem . It states that work done by a net force acting on a body is equal to the chnage in its kinetic energy.    Kinetic Energy:  It is the energy associated with a body during its motion. Suppose is the work done by a force on a body to displace it to a distance , then  The quantity is called the kinetic energy, i.e., Since this kinetic energy is associated with a body in translational motion, it is called a translational (linear) kinetic energy. The kinetic energy in rotational motion is called rotational kinetic energy which we will discuss in .    Potential Energy:  The energy stored in a body due to its position is known as potential energy. If work is done by a force to change the position of a body, then this work is stored in the body at that position in the form of potential energy. The restoring force plays a crucial role to acquire potential energy. For example, a charged particle near or far from another charge; a squashed or stretched rubber ball, a body above the surface of the earth. The potential energy of the body at any position is the work done against the restoring force in moving the body from the zero point (reference point) to that position. The reference point The zero point is so chosen that it could be infinitely far away. Such as at infinity, at the center of the earth, at sea level, at the floor, at the table top, or at any other point. This is because only potential energy differences between two positions are physically measurable and cannot depend on the a rbitrary choice of the zero point. (or, the zero point ) is the point where potential energy is assumed to be zero. If work has to be done on a body to take it to a new location, then the potential energy increases in the process. If the external force does the work then the potential energy change is negative.     Gravitational Potential Energy: Suppose a body of mass is lifted to a height against gravity without acceleration, then work done by the applied force, is given by This work is stored in the body in the form of gravitational potential energy. Hence when this body is released from the position the body drops down to the ground again. Therefore, the work done by the gravity to pull that object towards earth's surface is given by This is gravitational potential energy in a uniform gravitational field, . The gravitational potential energy due to two point masses is given by Where is the mass of an object at the origin, is the mass of an object at a radial distance from the origin and the zero point is chosen at infinity.     Elastic Potential Energy: When the body (or, spring) is compressed or stretched external force has to do the work, this work is stored in a body (or, spring) in the form of elastic potential energy. It is the energy due to work done by a restoring force. where is the restoring force [read for more details] , is elastic (or, spring) constant (it defines the stiffness of the spring), and is extension in the spring.    Since work done by a force in principle depends on the path taken by the body, (as can be seen in where is a frictional force), but if the force is conservative then work done is independent on the path taken by the body rather it depends on the initial and final position of the body [ ].

Non-conservative forces are dissipative forces such as friction or air resistance. These forces take energy away from the system as the system progresses, energy that you can't get back. These forces are path dependent and therefore it matters where the object starts and stops. Gravity, spring force, electric and magnetic, and other restoring forces are conservative. Friction, normal force, tension, and other applied forces are non-conservative. Conservative forces are state function, and non-conservatives forces are path function. The work done by a conservative force is independent of the path, i.e., the work done by a conservative force is the same for any path connecting two points.        Mathematically, the work done is independent of path if the infinitesimal work is an exact differential. In two dimensions, the condition for to be an exact differential is The work done by a non-conservative force depends on the path taken, i.e.,   "

That is, energy can neither be created nor be destroyed, it can only be converted from one form of energy to another. For example, when a block slides down a slope, potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. When friction slows the block to a stop, the kinetic energy is converted into thermal energy. In case of mechanical energy the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy is conserved.      For an interacting system, and for an isolated system, . Mechanical energy is due to the position and motion of the object. Therefore, Consider a body of mass is falling from rest at height to the ground. We are interested in its total energy at points A, B, and C as shown in . From the principle of conservation of energy, total energy at any point always remains same, i.e., Where When the body reaches to point B, then and  Using equation of motion in 1D,   Similarly,  Which proofs that the mechanical energy remains conserved at each and every point of the motion of an object.

  "body": " Energy Diagram               From the principle of conservation of energy as kinetic energy of the system increases its potential energy decreases. This means the force acting on a particle is the rate at which the potential energy decreases in any given direction as shown in . At point a, the slope of is positive, i.e., the x-component of the force is in the negative x direction. At the point b, the slope is negative and hence the force is positive. The force increases as the slope of increases. The point in the middle, at , is is a minimum of and hence the slope is zero. Therefore the x-directed force F at that point is zero as well. A point at which the force on an object is zero is a point of static equilibrium [ ], i.e., a particle is at rest and will remain there at rest. If the particle is displaced by a small distance to the right or the left of the equilibrium point, the force pushes the particle back towards equilibrium. Points where the force is zero and small displacements cause a restoring force to bring the particle back to the same points are called stable equilibrium points [ ].  Remember force is a negative gradient of the potential energy, i.e.,    That is, the force is a negative slope of the potential energy function in its direction. If a particle moves in the direction of the (conservative) force, it speeds up and its kinetic energy increases.  The forces between neutral atoms are extremely small, nearly zero, if atoms are very far away from one another. This is illustrated as an extended region where the potential energy is flat for large r as shown in . Such region is called neutral equilibrium [ ] because there are no forces that either restore or repel the two atoms. When two atoms reaches closer, their interaction becomes first weakly attractive due to quantum dipole-induced dipole interactions and then weakly repulsive as the two atoms start to touch each other. There is a potential energy minimum in between where two atoms separated by a certain distance can be in stable equilibrium without being chemically bound. If atoms approaches more closely then they encounter a second potential energy well that is at first strongly attractive to an actual chemical interaction between them followed by a hard core repulsion as the electron clouds are prevented from interpenetrating by the Pauli exclusion principle. This second potential energy well is often modeled by a Lenard-Jones potential energy corresponding to the inverse powers of . It also has a point of stable equilibrium. In between, there is a point where the growing attraction of the inner potential energy well and the growing repulsion of the outer potential energy well balance, so that the potential energy function has a maximum. At this maximum the slope is zero, a position of force equilibrium but because the force on either side of this point pushes the particle away from it, this is a point of unstable equilibrium [ ]. Unstable equilibria occur at isolated maxima in the potential energy function, just as stable equilibria occur at isolated minima. Introductory Physics-I, Robert Brown, Duke University   "

  "body": " Simple Machine  A simple machine is a device that acts to increase or decrease the amount of output force, , by the machine compared to the input force, to the machine. Machines can increase the speed of doing work. Machine can transfer energy from one form to another.      A lever is a simple machine that consists of a beam (or solid rod), a fulcrum (or pivot point), an input force (or effort), and an output force (or load) [ ]. The beam is placed in such a way that the fulcrum acts as a point of rotation of the beam. The fulcrum remains stationary, while a force is applied somewhere along the length of the beam. The beam then pivots around the fulcrum, exerting the output force on some sort of object that needs to be moved. For example, a crowbar is used to pry up a nail, an effort force is applied to generate an output force, which is what pulls the nail out. Simple machine obeys the principle of conservation of energy, i.e., Input work = output work.    where is the distance of effort pushed down and is distance of load lift up.  There are three basic types of lever.     Class 1 Levers: This is a configuration where the fulcrum is in between the input and output forces, such as a seesaw (teeter-totter), catapult, pliers, and scissors [ and ].                  Class 2 Levers: The load comes between the input force and the fulcrum, such as in a bottle opener, crowbar, wheelbarrow, and nut cracker [ and ].                  Class 3 levers: The fulcrum is on one end and the load is on the other end, with the effort in between the two, such as with a pair of tweezers, stapler, mousetrap, and broom [ and ].                 Since lever works at rotational equilibrium, the total torque must be zero, i.e.,  Where and are lengths of effort arm and load arm, respectively. From eqns. and , we have -   "

  "body": " Pulley                Another type of simple machine is a pulley. The pulley is just a lever in disguise. A single fixed pulley acts like a lever with equal arms. It changes only the direction of the input force. When a person pulls down on the rope, the load is lifted up as shown in . In a single movable pulley, the load can be lifted with an input force that is only half of the load's true weight .    Mechanical Advantage  Simple machine makes work easier to do. Mechanical advantage is used to quantify how easy to do the work by using simple machine. The number of times input force is multiplied under ideal conditions, i.e., when no friction present, is called an Ideal Mechanical Advantage , IMA. The number of times input force is multiplied under real world conditions, i.e., when friction is present, is called an Actual Mechanical Advantage , AMA.     Types of Pulley                              Single Fixed Pulley: This pulley does not multiply the input force. It does change the direction of the force from up to down [ ].        One Fixed and One Movable Pulley: This pulley does multiply the input force and change the direction of the force as well [ ].           Two Fixed and One Movable Pulley: This pulley change the direction of the force, and it also multiplies it [ ].            Two Fixed and Two Movable Pulley: This pulley change the direction of the force, and it also multiplies it [ ].      Suppose the load, then the actual input force would be a little greater than the ideal value of , say 25N in this case, It might be 30 N. The extra 5 newtons is used to overcome the friction.  The AMA will always be less than the IMA.    The value of IMA in case of pulley can be easily determined by just looking at the picture. Just count the number of strands of rope that directly support the load. In , there is 4 strands of rope supporting the load, In , 3 strands of rope supporting the load, In , there is 5 strands supporting the load, Besides lever and pulley, there are four other simple machines. They are the screw, the inclined plane, the wedge, and the wheel & axle.   Efficiency       "

  "title": "Collision",
  "body": " Collision   A collision collision is an interaction between two objects that may or may not have made physical contact. In a collision the colliding objects experience a pair of forces acting on them. The direction of the force on the first object is opposite to the direction of the force on the second object and these forces are equal in magnitude. These forces are Newton's III law pair. In an isolated system, total momentum is always conserved, hence such forces often increase the momentum of one object and decrease the momentum of the other. There are two kinds of collisions, elastic collision and inelastic collision.  Total energy is always conserved in any types of collision. In collision three steps are considered to understand the problems. They are before collision: objects approach each other with a kinetic energy due to their movement, during collision: objects interact and transfer their momentum. The kinetic energy is transformed into elastic potential energy stored in the spring-like molecular bonds, and after collision: the stored elastic potential energy is converted into kinetic energy as the objects move away from each other [ ].      Here and are velocities of body 1 and 2 before and after collision, respectively.  Consider two objects of mass and having velocity and , respectively are moving in 1-dimension and that so that they collide along their way. Suppose that both objects are subject to zero net force unless they are in contact with one another. During the collision, the first object exerts a large transitory force on the second, whereas the second object exerts an equal and opposite force on the first. That is, they transfer equal and opposite impulses on one another at the instant of collision. If and are the velocity of the objects after collision, and there is no external force acting on the objects then from the principle of conservation of momentum, we have  This equation is valid for any 1-dimensional collision, irrespective of its nature.    Inelastic Collision  A collision in which total momentum is conserved but the total kinetic energy is not conserved before and after the collision is known as inelastic collision. That is, some of their kinetic energy is converted into heat, or sound, or deformation. If the two objects stick together after the collision and move with a common velocity then the collision is said to be perfectly inelastic. Most collisions in practice are inelastic. Perfectly inelastic collisions usually involve easily deformed obj ects e.g. wet clay. Since momentum is conserved in an inelastic collision eqn. can help solve the problem. In perfectly inelastic collision , after the collision, hence from eqn. , we have -     Elastic Collision  A collision in which total momentum and total kinetic energy are conserved before and after the collision is known as elastic collision. That is there is no dissipative force acting during the collision and that all of the kinetic energy of the objects before the collision is still in the form of kinetic energy afterward. Any macroscopic collision between objects will convert some of the kinetic energy into internal energy and other forms of energy, so no large scale impacts are perfectly elastic. Elastic collisions usually involve sub-atomic particles or highly rigid objects e.g. steel or glass balls. If both objects have same mass, their velocities swap after perfectly elastic collision, e.g. Newton's cradle. \"Collisions\" in which the objects do not touch each other, such as Rutherford scattering or the slingshot orbit of a satellite off a planet, are elastic collisions. In atomic or nuclear scattering, the collisions are typically elastic because the repulsive Coulomb force keeps the particles out of contact with each other. Collisions in ideal gases are very nearly elastic, and this fact is used in the development of the expressions for gas pressure in a container. Since total momentum and total kinetic energy is conserved in elastic collision, eqn. along with eqn. can help solve the problem,      Collision in 2D  A collision in two dimensions obeys the same rules as a collision in one dimension. That is,  Total momentum in each direction is always the same before and after the collision, and  Total kinetic energy is the same before and after an elastic collision.    Consider the first object of mass , initially moves along the -axis with speed and the second object of mass , initially moves at an angle to the -axis with speed .                  For inelastic collision: If the two objects stick together and move off at an angle to the -axis with speed [ ]. Then from principle of conservation of momentum,     For elastic collision [ ]:     These equations can help sove the 2D collision problems.    Coefficient of Restitution, e   coefficient of restitution    coefficient of restitution  The coefficient of restitution, is defined as the ratio of relative speeds after and before an impact, taken along the line of impact. If represents how fast the objects are separating from one another after collision, and represents how fast the objects are approaching one another before collision, then where, , , are final and initial velocities of the two particles, respectively. The coefficient of restitution, for perfectly inelastic collision and for perfectly elastic collision, i.e., .  If the magnitude of the relative velocity does not change during a collision, then the change in kinetic energy is zero. Collisions in which no change in kinetic energy occurs are called elastic collisions, . If the magnitude of the final relative velocity is less than the magnitude of the initial relative velocity, then the change in kinetic energy is negative. Collisions in which the kinetic energy decreases are called inelastic collisions, . If the two objects stick together after the collision, then the relative final velocity is zero, Such collisions are called totally inelastic. If the magnitude of the final relative velocity is greater than the magnitude of the initial relative velocity, then the change in kinetic energy is positive. Collisions in which the kinetic energy increases are called superelastic collisions,    "

Hence, Where and are the mass of earth, mass of a body on the surface of the earth, and the radius of the earth, respectively. The shape of earth is not a perfect sphere, rather, it is an oblate spheroid.

Effect of the Rotation of the Earth on g      The value of on the surface of the earth does not only vary with the radius of the earth but it is also affected by the rotation of the earth. Any mass rotating in a circular motion needs a centripetal force which is acting towards the center of the circular path.

Hence the part of gravitational force must be acting on a body to provide a necessary centripetal force to keep that object moving on a circle with the rotation of the earth as shown in .  Since the centripetal force required by the mass m to follow a circle of radius r, then this force must be provided by the vector difference in force of gravity and a real force , i.e.,   The magnitude of can be found by   where R is the radius of the earth, and the acceleration due to gravity on a non-rotating earth is     Effect of Altitude of the Earth on g      Acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the earth is given by At height from the surface of the earth [Figure ], acceleration due to gravity is given by  using binomial theorem     Effect of Depth of the Earth on g      Acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the earth is given by where mass of the entire earth, At depth from the surface of the earth, mass of the earth [ ].

It is the distance from the axis of rotation where the entire mass of the body is assumed to be concentrated that give the same moment of inertia of that body when it is rotating about an axis of rotation. It is an equivalent distance of the mass from the axis of rotation. It is helpfull to obtain the moment of inertia of a complex object. The radius of gyration of mass is given by Here refers to the radius of gyration of the object. The radius of gyration of a spherical body about its diameter can be obtained by considering the entire body is concentrated as a point mass at a distance from the axis of rotation and hence The radius of gyration provides a way to quantify how the mass of an object is distributed relative to its axis of rotation. Objects with a larger radius of gyration have their mass distributed farther from the axis of rotation, which typically means they are harder to rotate. Conversely, objects with a smaller radius of gyration have their mass distributed closer to the axis of rotation, making them easier to rotate.  "

  "body": " Angular Momentum  A rigid body rotating with angular velocity, about a fixed axis has an angular momentum about this axis which is given by where is the moment of inertia of the body about this axis. To change the angular momentum of a body, an external torque must be applied to it. Similar to in linear dynamics, we have in rotational dynamics That is, the torque acting on a rigid body is equal to the rate of change of the angular momentum. The direction of torque is along the change in angular momentum. The direction of angular momentum is along the angular velocity, which is along the axis of rotation. In the absence of external torques, the angular momentum of a rigid body must be constant, in other words, there is no change in the angular momentum when the sum of the external torques is zero. This is known as the principle of conservation of angular momentum, i.e., Similarly, the angular impulse Thus the change in angular momentum is equal to the angular impulse. Again,       Hence angular momentum is also called moment of momentum. It is a vector quantity. It is acting along the direction perpendicular to the plane subtends by and The angular momentum of a point particle is a measure of the circulation of the particle's linear momentum about some specific point. In , is a position vector of mass, measured from point  here is a component of velocity (or momentum) along position vector . If the position vector and the velocity are contained in the x-y plane then the angular momentum is either along the +z axis or along the -z axis. If the right hand fingers pointed along the position vector curl along the velocity vector, then thumb will give the direction of angular momentum. In the if the right hand fingers are along the red dashed line curled towards the momentum vector then thumb is pointed out of the paper.                   The angular momentum vector depends on the position vector of the point particle, therefore it depends on the point from which the particle's position is measured. Consider a particle of mass moving along the axis with velocity as shown in , then the angular momentum of this particle is given with respect to points and are   where is pointed into the paper [figure ].

The string is connected to a center axle of the disk so that the disk is free to rotate. The moment of inertia of the disk about its axle is The coefficient of static friction between the slope and the block\/disk is 0.05 and the coefficient of kinetic friction between the slope and the block\/disk is 0.15. The angle is Find the maximum ratio such that the disk still rolls without slipping up the hill.      Since the disk is rolling without slipping, the maximum friction acting on the point of contact of disk and ramp must be static (i.e., ). Now, whether the system is accelerating or not for the maximum ratio of can be determined by the evaluation of final equation. From the free-body diagram construct equations as shown below. From [Figure (b)] consider the disk is accelerating upwards with an acceleration for now, then           From [Figure (c)] the disk is accelerating downwards with an acceleration because the block is connected to the disk through same rope via massless and frictionless pulley and hence has the same tension and acceleration, therefore     Now from eqns. , and , we get - and from eqns. , and , we get - Hence from eqns. and , and we have -   If the system is not accelerating but moving with constant velocity, then Hence in that case        The disk of mass 45 kg and radius R = 0.3 m is rolled to the left until the spring is compressed 0.5 m and then released from rest. If the spring constant is k = 600 N\/m, and  if the disk rolls without slipping, what is its angular acceleration at the instant it is released?  What is the minimum coefficient of static friction for which the disk will not slip when it is released?        Given: From free-body diagram,                      A uniform disk of mass m and radius R is attached to the uniform rod of mass M and length L. The rod rotates with an angular speed about an axis perpendicular to the xy-plane and that passes through one of its ends, point O as shown in figure. The center of mass of the disk is at a distance l with respect to point O. Calculate the angular momentum about this point.      The angular momentum of a composite object is obtained as the sum of the angular momentum of each of its constituents.  The composites have same angular velocity, . Now, moment of inertia of a rod about its end, Also, moment of inertia of a disk about point using parallel axis theorem,        A small ball of mass traveling with initial velocity hits a disk at rest of mass and radius at a vertical distance from the disk's center. The ball bounces back horizontally with a velocity and the disk begins rolling without slipping. Find the velocity of the disk after it has begun rolling without slipping.                   A uniform thin rod of length and mass can rotate in a horizontal plane about a vertical axis through its center. The rod is at rest when a bullet of mass traveling in the horizontal plane of the rod is fired into one end of the rod. The direction of the bullet's velocity makes an angle degrees with the rod. If the bullet lodges in the rod and the angular velocity of the rod is rad\/s immediately after the collision, what is the magnitude of the bullet's velocity, m\/s just before impact? Determine the kinetic energy of the bullet before the collision and total rotational kinetic energy after the collision.        Kinetic energy of bullet before collision, and total rotational kinetic energy after the collision,       A disk is spinning at a rate of 10 rad\/s. A second disk of the same mass and shape, with no spin, is placed on top of the first disk. Friction acts between the two disks until both are eventually traveling at the same speed. What is the final angular velocity of the two disks?               A particle attached to a string of length 2 m is given an initial velocity of 6 m\/s. The string is attached to a peg and, as the particle rotates about the peg, the string winds around the peg. What length of string has wound around the peg when the velocity of the particle is 20 m\/s?    when string is winding around the peg its length decreases gradually causing the radius of rotation to decrease accordingly. Hence its moment of inertia decreases gradually and from conservation of angular momentum, angular velocity of the particle increases gradually.     Hence of string has already wound around the peg when the velocity is 20 m\/s.      A rotating round object has an initial angular velocity placed onto the horizontal surface. It rolls with slipping till achieve a final angular velocity . If moment of inertia of the body is .  Find .  If find the shape of the round object.        when rotating object is placed on the surface its initial velocity Now due to frction translational velocity of the object is reduced after a time when object starts rolling without slipping with an angular velocity     also,   After time on rolling without slipping,         Hence the round object is a hollow sphere.

  "title": "Simple Harmonic Motion",
  "body": " Simple Harmonic Motion   Phasor Diagram     If a body oscillates repeatedly ( to and fro ) between two extremes in equal interval of time then the motion is called a simple harmonic motion. It is the simplest form of oscillatory motion. The moving particle follows the same velocity at the same displacement of its oscillation and the restoring force always pointed towards the mean position. The bouncing ball motion is oscillatory but not simple harmonic. A particle moving in a uniform circular motion in a given phasor diagram [ ] can be seen as a foot ( ) of the particle executing SHM.  The angular velocity of the particle is therefore the same as angular frequency of the foot of the particle executing SHM as shown in . As the particle moves on a circle its foot, M executes up and down motion which traces a sinusoidal curve with respect to time. Some important terminologies are given below to understand SHM.   Amplitude, :  amplitude The maximum displacement of the oscillating particle on either side of its mean position.   Time Period, :  time period Time taken by oscillatory particle to complete one oscillation is called time period.   Frequency, :  frequency The number of oscillation completed per unit time is called frequency. If is the time period, then frequency, is given by    Angular frequency, :  angular frequency It is a circular frequency which measures angular displacement per unit time. Its unit is radians\/sec. It is a scalar quantity. In circular motion, angular frequency and angular velocity is used interchangeably.   Phase, :  phase It is the initial position (in angle) of a particle at time If the particle executing SHM is at mean position when then if it is at its extreme positions then         The followings are some features to recognize simple harmonic motion (SHM). Any of these features guarantee the motion is SHM in nature.  Restoring force is proportional to displacement from equilibrium position, i.e., where is a proportionality constant and is a displacement from the equilibrium.  ime period, is independent of the amplitude of oscillation.  Potential energy is proportional to .  The graphs for position vs time, ( ); velocity vs time, ( ); and acceleration vs time, ( ) are all sinusoidal [ ].      Equation of SHM  Equation for simple harmonic oscillation can be obtained by considering a spring-mass system, but the equation can be used for any other system performing SHM. Consider a block of mass attached to the spring and one end of spring is fixed to the wall. If the block is displaced by the distance from the mean position of spring-block system and released on a frictionless surface then restoring force of spring is proportional to the displacement. That is,  Where is proportionality constant, called a force constant. It defines the elastic property of material, hence it is also called elastic constant. For spring we may also called as stiffness constant. However, if the restoring force has some other source then elastic property of material then is simply a proportionality constant and depends on the nature of space, e.g. gravitational field in case of simple pendulum. sign here shows restoring force is always opposite to the displacement from the mean position. Equation is Hook's Law, we can discuss this law in the chapter Elasticity .   Where is the angular frequency (velocity) of the object executing SHM or performing circular motion. Angular frequency, is taken as because phaser always revolves anticlockwise. In the , is a mean length of spring-mass system and is displacement from the equilibrium position at any time . Here point is equilibrium position and points and are two extremes. Now as acceleration, is a function of and is also a function of we can also have velocity, . Therefore,                 put, or      Where is a phase of oscillating particle. The displacement of oscillating particle can also be obtained by using Either solutions will work perfectly fine in solving shm problems. However, we can use cosine term solution if time when the particle is at its extreme position. If time when the particle is at mean position sine term solution will suffice. Here we are using as a solution for the differential equation. Hence the velocity of such particle at any time is given by and the acceleration of this particle is Time period of oscillation in spring-mass system is given by     Alternative solution to   We can find the solution of by the following way  This is second order differential equation with constant coefficient. The solution of such equation can be found by guessing which depends upon the nature of the curve that we precept in SHM, which is sinusoidal in this case. Hence we can guess that  will be the solution of given differential equation. The advanced way of finding the solution of such type of differential equation is to find the nature of roots of the equation and then the solution can be given by . Where and are arbitrary constants, and and are roots of the auxiliary equation.

[ ] Now since restoring force involved in spring mass system is conservative, the total mechanical energy is conserved [ ]. Here is a spring constant, is the amplitude of vibrating spring and the velocity of the particle executing SHM is zero at extremes. Let the spring oscillates in vertical up and down then the solution for SHM is given by      From eqn. , we have -  means mass is oscillating in up and down direction, i.e. Now  Note: The same result could be obtained by considering equation of SHM as        Summary of Phasor Diagram for    Points    s      KE  PE                                                                    "

  "title": "Elastic Modulus",
  "body": " Elastic Modulus   From Hook's law,  where is a proportionality constant, called modulus of elasticity. It is a material property which defines how stiff is the material. Hence modulus of elasticity, defines stress per unit strain. Its unit is Pascal (Pa). In the deformation process material stores energy in the form of potential energy or dissipates energy plastically. Stress is not directly measurable. We can calculate stress differently using applied tension, tangential force, compressional force, etc.    Young's Modulus or Elasticity of Length      Consider a rod of length whose top face is fixed and a normal force is being applied on its bottom face as shown in , then from Hook's law, normal (tensile) stress longitudinal strain, that is where is called Young's modulus, is cross-sectional area of wire, and is an original length. Hence    Young's modulus  Its unit is When a wire under tension is elongated, its width is slightly diminished. This lateral shrinkage constitutes a transverse strain that is equal to the change in the width divided by the original width, i.e., The ratio of the lateral contraction (transverse strain) to the elongation (longitudinal strain) is called Poisson's ratio . Tensile deformation is considered positive and compressive deformation is considered negative. The material which does not contract is brittle and the one which contracts is ductile. Poisson ratio of any material lies between 0 to 0.5.    Bulk Modulus or Elasticity of Volume      Consider a cube of surface area whose volume is being compressed by applying a deforming force as shown in . Now from Hook's law, volumetric stress volumetric strain, that is where is called bulk modulus or coefficient of volumetric elasticity. Hence Here is a deforming force, is surface area of a cube, is change in volume , and sign shows compression.    Shear Modulus (Modulus of Rigidity) or Elasticity of Shape  When a tangential force is applied on one of the faces of any material keeping opposite face fixed, it deforms its shape. Hence from Hook's law, shear stress shear strain. The elastic property of a body that causes the shape of the body to be changed when a stress is applied is called shear stress. The angle of shear, which is a measure of how much the body's shape has been deformed is called shear strain. When the shear stress is removed the body returns to its original shape.      Consider a cube of sides y whose bottom face is fixed and a tangential force is being applied on its top face as shown in , then from Hook's law, shear stress shear strain, that is   where is called modulus of shape or shear modulus. Hence Here is a deforming force, is surface area of a cube, and is a shear angle.   "

  "body": " Pascal's Principle   Pascal's principle states that pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted equally to every portion of the fluid and the walls of the container. This principle is valid only for an incompressible fluid which is most of the liquid. Hydraulic press  hydraulic press is one of the good examples of Pascal's principle. It is a device to lift heavy objects. It has two cylindrical opening attached the horizontal tube as shown in . An incompressible liquid is filled in the device. It works on Pascal's principle and obeys the conservation of energy. Work done on the a pump (small cylindrical piston) to push it down is equal to the work done by the big piston to lift heavy objects like vehicle, elephant, etc. Let a force is applied on one piston to push it to a distance then it lifts the weight to a distance on the other pan attached to the second piston.          Since the hydraulic fluid is incompressible  which is the Pascal's principle. Also  Since area of cross-section, is greater than area of cross-section, a small force can generate a compressive force     Measurement of Fluid Pressure  Pressure measurement is important in many occasions in our daily life. To check tire pressure, pressure in balloon filled with air, pressure inside a pipe carrying fluid, pressure in gas cylinder, pressure in boiler used in industries, and pressure inside an airplane cabin. Two basic types of pressure measuring devices have been discussed here.     Manometer:  manometer Manometer is is a U-shaped tube used to measure pressure of a fluid at rest. It contains water, mercury, or any other suitable fluid in the tube. When a pressure line is connected to one column of manometer, the fluid in the column will be forced down, and the fluid in the other will rise as shown in . By measuring the difference in height of the fluid in the two columns, the pressure of the inlet can be expressed in length.            Here is an atmospheric pressure acting on the open end of manometer, and are densities of fluids in container A and in U-tube, respectively. Pressure at points A and B are same and the pressure at points C and D are same. Hence pressure in column BC is balanced by pressure in column DE.   alternate:         Barometer  barometer It is the simplest pressure gauge used for measuring atmospheric pressure. It is designed by Torricelli . A meter long tube completely filled with mercury is inverted in a mercury container in such a way that the open end of the tube is under the pool of mercury. Now on balancing the atmospheric pressure acting on the mercury container the mercury column in the tube drops to a certain height and creating a complete vacuum at the top of the tube and hence the pressure is zero at point C. In the , points A and B are at the same level so they have the same pressure.       This device measures atmospheric pressure, rather than gauge pressure, because there is a nearly pure vacuum above the mercury in the tube.     "

  "body": " Archimedes' Principle  When an object is placed in a fluid it experiences an upthrust force called a buoyant force . It is arising due to changes of the pressure inside fluid. This phenomenon is known as Archimedes' principle. It states that when a body is fully or partially immersed in a fluid, the fluid exerts an upward force on the body equal to the weight of liquid displaced . That is, buoyant force (B) = weight of displaced fluid. Liquid does not distinguish between the volume of its own or the volume of some thing else. Meaning if we replace some arbitrary volume of the liquid with some other object of the same volume then the liquid applies the same force on its surface, and .                           If and are the mass and volume of displaced fluid and is the density of fluid then weight of displaced fluid is given by Due to buoyant force body appear lighter than it really is. Hence, the weight of a body in the fluid is called an apparent weight. Weight loss of a body is equal to weight of liquid displaced. That is, Where and are weight of a body in air and in the fluid, respectively. Apparent weight is the net downward force.  Hence apparent loss in weight = buoyant force = weight of water displaced.  If an object floats, then its apparent weight is zero. If its apparent weight is more than zero, it sinks. A floating object loss all of its weight.    If the body is completely submerged but suspended in the fluid [ ], then from Newton's second law net force acting on the body is zero. That is, buoyant force is equal to weight of the body  Since body is completely immersed in the fluid, . Hence,  The body will suspend in a fluid if their densities are same.  If the body is floating in the fluid [ ], then buoyant force is greater than the weight of the body. Hence body comes to a float, but at the surface of the fluid, net force acting on the body is zero.  Since body is floating in the fluid, volume of the displaced fluid is then only equal to immersed portion of the body. Hence   The body will float in a fluid if the densities of fluid is greater than that of the body.  If the body is sinking in the fluid [ ], then buoyant force is less than the weight of the body. Hence body sinks, but at the bottom of the fluid, net force acting on the body is zero.  Since Hence for to be +ve, must be positive. Here is the apparent weight of the body in the fluid.     "

The flow rate is a measure of the flow of mass (volume) of fluid per unit time.      Consider a tube [ ] with areas of cross-section at one end and at another end. If mass of fluid is entering into the tube in time then the same amount of fluid must be leaving out of the tube in the same interval of time because fluid is incompressible.

  "body": " Applications of Bernoulli's Principle:     Airplane Wing  The top of the airplane wing is curved, while the bottom of the wing is totally flat. When an airplane runs air travels across the top of the wing is faster then it travels below the bottom part of the wing so that the air molecules travel equal distance in equal time ( equal transit theory ) to catch each other at the end of the wing. This phenomenon creates high pressure at the bottom and less pressure at the top. This pressure difference creates lift and allows planes to fly or take off easily [ ].        Spinning Ball  The ball spins in such a way that it decreases the velocity of air at top and increases the the velocity of air on the bottom. Which allows more air pressure on the top of the ball and less air pressure at the bottom of the ball. Due to which the ball accelerates downwards faster than the top part and the ball curves downward, which causes the batter to miscalculate the ball's position [ ].        Venturi Meter  It is a device used to measure the speed of the fluid. It is a broad tube with constriction at the middle as shown in . A manometer of U-shape is attached to it with one arm at the broad side and the other at the constriction. When the speed of incompressible fluid increases at the constriction, it lowers the pressure at that point. The pressure difference causes the manometer fluid (water) in the tube to rise in one arm and depressed at the other arm. The difference in height, measures the pressure difference. From Bernoulli's principle        Since the horizontal axis of the venturi meter is passing through the points M and N is at same height. Therefore  From equation of continuity,  where and are area of cross-section of the venturi tube at wide section and at the constriction.  The pressure difference between points M and N is also the pressure difference between the manaometer fluid at two points. That is the top of the water column on the left-hand side of the U-tube and the water column on the right-hand side. Hence, where is a gauge pressure in manometer. This equation will help find the speed of fluid (gas or liquid) entering into the venturi tube.    Siphon Effect  when one end of a pipe is deep into liquid and suck the air out from another end then there is vacuum created in the pipe and pressure gets low with respect to the atmospheric pressure at the surface of reservoir. This reduced pressure sucks the liquid up against the gravity and hence once the liquid rises up to the top of the pipe and due to gravity it begins flowing to the lower end of the siphon pipe to exit [ ].         There are numerous applications of Bernoulli's principle found in our daily life, e.g., spray atomizer, throwing of frisbees, flying of kites, Bird's wing design, water pump, etc.  "

  "body": " Coefficient of Viscosit  If we observe the flow of water in a river flowing continuously and smoothly, we will be able to notice that water near the edge of the river flows slower than the water flowing near the middle of the river. When a fluid is flowing past a stationary wall, the fluid right close to the wall is almost at rest but the fluid away from the wall flows with relatively higher speed. So a velocity gradient exists between layers in fluid flow. This is due to adhesive, cohesive, and frictional forces acting between adjacent layers of the fluid. The velocity gradient (i.e., the change in speed with distances) is a characteristic of the fluid. This is used to define the coefficient of viscosity We limit our discussion here only on laminar flow of liquid.  In a layer has higher speed than its adjacent layer , so layer A applies force on B to move it faster, but layer B pushes layer A backward so that they go together. Such pushing and pulling between the layers creates a drag force called a viscous force . Consider a shear force F is required to keep the layer of fluid moving at a constant velocity v, then it can be observed through the experiments that this force depends on the following four factors. This force     is proportional to velocity of the layer of liquid ( ),  is proportional to the surface area of layer having the velocity v ( )  is inversely proportional to the distance of the layer from the stationary wall ( ) Mathematically,    If is the distance between adjacent layers and is the difference in their velocities, then the viscous force is given in differential form as where, is a proportionality constant, called coefficient of viscosity and it defines the property of the fluid. The greater the coefficient of viscosity , the greater the force required to move the layer of fluid at a velocity v. The term is called a velocity gradient. The fluids which obey this equation are called Newtonian fluids and is independent of the speed of flow. If does depend on the velocity of flow the fluids are called non-Newtonian . Blood is an example of a non-Newtonian fluid. The SI unit of viscosity is or, . A common unit of viscosity is the poise where   Viscosity is temperature dependent. Viscosity of a liquid decreases with increasing temperature and that for a gas increases with increasing temperature.  "

The rate of flow of fluid in a tube is dependent on its viscosity, pressure difference between the two ends of the tube (or, pressure gradient), and the radius of the tube. Posiseuille assume the laminar flow of incompressible fluid (mostly liquid) to obtain the Poiseuille's equation.  Consider a uniform circular cylindrical tube of radius and length in which liquid has a laminar flow. Consider a layer of liquid at distance from the center of the tube is moving with velocity , then the viscous force acting on this layer is given by  sign indicates that the viscous force is acting opposite to the direction of otion of the liquid, is the surface area of the liquid, and is the velocity gradient of the layer.

  "body": " Capillary Action               Surface tension arises due to strong intermolecular forces of attraction between the molecules. When those forces act between like molecules, they are referred to as cohesive forces . Cohesion is a tendency of the liquid to remain as one assembly of particles. Surface tension is due to cohesion between particles at the free surface. A liquid, however, is often in contact with a solid surface, such as glass. Hence the additional forces of attraction occur between molecules of the liquid and molecules of the solid surface. When the attractive forces act between unlike molecules, they are said to be adhesive forces . This property enables a liquid to stick to another body.  Capillary is a phenomenon by which a liquid rises up into a narrow tube (called capillary ) above or below its general level. The upper surface of a liquid in a tube is called the meniscus , and the shape of the meniscus depends on the relative strengths of the cohesive and adhesive forces. In liquids such as water, the meniscus is concave, because of high adhesive forces between water and glass molecules. In liquids such as mercury, the meniscus is convex because the molecules of mercury have very strong cohesive forces and weak adhesion to glass. The height to which the water rises depends on the diameter of the tube and the temperature of the water but not on the angle of tilt of the tube in water. The smaller the diameter, the higher the liquid rises.                   Capillary action provides wetting ability of liquids on the solid interfaces. The contact angle between the liquid boundary and the solid surface is a measure of the degree of wetting. Adhesion and surface tension together can produce capillary action. Capillary action occurs when the adhesion to the walls is stronger than the cohesive forces between the liquid molecules. Adhesion of water to the walls of a vessel results in an upward force on the liquid at the edges. The water keep rising in the capillary till the weight of this portion of water is balanced by the vertical component of such upward force. From , we have -     Here is density of liquid like water, is radius of capillary, and is angle of contact. A smaller contact angle and a smaller surface tension result in a greater the degree of wetting. When adhesive forces are greater than cohesive forces, the contact angle lies between 0 and When adhesive forces are smaller than cohesive forces, the contact angle lies between and [ and ]. When water is dripping from the narrow orifice its shape is a little bit oval because of gravity. However, the shape would be completely spherical in absence of gravity because of surface tension of the water.  "

  "title": "Temperature and Thermometers",
  "body": " Temperature and Thermometers   There are varieties of thermometers in existence. Based on the phases of materials used in thermometer they are solid state thermometer, liquid thermometer, and gas thermometer. Many physical properties of materials change significantly with temperature can be used as the basis for constructing thermometers. Solid thermometer works upon the principle that resistances of solid objects are proportional to changes in its temperature. Liquid thermometer works upon the principle that expansion in liquid volume are proportional to changes in its temperature. Gas thermometer works upon the principle that changes in gas pressure are proportional to changes in gas temperature. Here mainly discussed about liquid thermometer. Liquid thermometers, such as mercury-in-glass or alcohol thermometers, have been widely used for temperature measurement for many years. However, due to toxic effect of mercury for living being mercury thermometers are not much in use these days. The different calibration process of thermometers produces different types of temperature scales. They are Centigrade (Celsius) scale [ ], Fahrenheit scale[ ], and Kelvin scale [ ]. There are some other types of scales like Rankine's or Reamer's thermometers available but they are almost obsolete. A centigrade thermometer has 100 divisions between the freezing point (0 degree Celsius) and the boiling point (100 degree Celsius) of water. Swedish astronomer Andres Celsius is credited for its development. A temperature of 76 degree Celsius is abbreviated as The Celsius scale is the most widely accepted temperature scale in the world except the United States. In Fahrenheit thermometer, there are 180 divisions between the freezing point (32 degree Fahrenheit) and the boiling point (212 degree Fahrenheit) of water. German physicist Daniel Fahrenheit is credited for its development. It is the first modern thermometer developed in 1714. A temperature of 76 degree Fahrenheit is abbreviated as    Thermometers    Celcius Scale     Fahrenheit Scale     Kelvin Scale      Kelvin scale of temperature is the standard metric system of temperature measurement and mostly used by scientists. The Kelvin scale has 100 equal degree increments between the freezing point and the boiling point of water just as the Celsius scale. However, the zero-degree mark on the Kelvin scale is 273.15 units cooler than it is on the Celsius scale. So a temperature of 0 Kelvin is equivalent to a temperature of Traditionally, degree symbol is not used with the Kelvin scale. So a temperature of 300 units above 0 Kelvin is referred to as 300 Kelvin and not 300 degree Kelvin. Hence 300 Kelvin is abbreviated as 300 K. Conversions among Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales are summarized below.  Consider these thermometers are placed in a cup of coffey where Celsius scale reads a temperature of C, Fahrenheit scale reads a temperature of F, and Kelvin scale reads a temperature of K, then we can find their relationship as follows Here and are unknown temperature, boiling point of water, and freezing point of water in the respective thermometers, respectively. We have used here freezing point of water as 273 K instead of 273.15 K, just for simplicity.  Eqn. provides the temperature conversion between any two scales. Such as for Celsius\/Kelvin scale,  For Fahrenheit\/Celsius scale,     "

  "title": "Absolute Scale",
  "body": " Absolute Scale  A physical thermometer uses the physical properties of a material or substance to determine temperature. It relies on the fact that certain physical properties change in a predictable way with temperature. Examples of physical thermometers include mercury-in-glass thermometers, alcohol thermometers, and bimetallic strip thermometers. These thermometers use the expansion and contraction of materials (e.g., mercury or alcohol) to indicate temperature changes. The scale of normal thermometers depends upon the physical propertise (thermal expansion, electrical resistance, etc) of the substance which is used in the thermometer. The physical property (e.g. thermal expansion) of materials varies differently at the different range of temperatures hence all these thermometers have fixed uses. For example, a mercury thermometer can measure temperature ranges from approximately to ( to ). For alcohol thermometer, the typical temperature range is approximately to ( to ). That means, if we go to Antarctica we must bring with us an alcohol thermometer and when going to Lut Desert a hotest place on earth, we need a mercury thermometer. Mercury thermometer may freeze in Antarctica and alcohol thermometer may boil in Lut Desert. To remedy such problems of limitation of physical thermometers, Scottish physicist William Thomson, Baron Kelvin proposed to constructing a temperature scale which should be independent on the material properties on the basis of thermodynamics principles that the lowest possible temperature which could be achieved was in 1848. This minimum temperature is the zero point on Kelvin scale and is known as absolute zero . Kelvin scale is a hypothetical (theoretical) thermometer scale also known as absolute scale . From third law of thermodynamics, it is impossible to reach absolute zero temperature by any physical means.       Temperature is a measure of average kinetic energy per molecule of any substance. In classical mechanical point of view, molecular motion ceases completely at absolute zero and hence possesses zero kinetic energy. (However, in quantum mechanical point if view, at absolute zero molecular motion takes minimum speed of its vibration.) It has been seen from the gas laws that the product of pressure and volume is directly proportional to temperature [ ]. In fact, all gases have energy ( ) heading to zero at the same temperature called absolute zero. At absolute zero the pressure of an ideal gas would drop to zero.  "

At temperatures below water exists as a solid ice, occupying a bigger volume. When heated, it expands like normal solid up to It begins melting at to liquid water without any change in temperature. Melting is accompanied by a decrease in its volume by about . As temperature increases above water contracts further up to and occupies the minimum volume at . Therefore water has maximum density at which is about Above , water expands like any other liquid. This behavior of water is described as anomalous, unusual, irregular, or peculiar behavior of water. The importance of anomalous properties of water can be summarized as:  During cold weather, the temperature of lakes drops and water contracts, becomes denser and sinks. A circulation of water is thus set up until all the water attain maximum density i.e. at . If further cooling occurs (below ), then any water below will stay at the top due to its lower density. At ice forms on top and this acts as an insulator to the layers below. Hence the relatively warm water underneath ice layer can help sustain aquatic life.  Ice has a slightly lower density than that of water and hence it floats with a small portion above the water surface. The rest and a larger portion of the ice rests under water. This is called an iceberg. Icebergs pose a great danger to ships as the submerged parts cannot be seen easily by navigators.    "

Any material can exist in three different states solid, liquid, and gas are also known as the phases of matter. When ice is heated it melts into liquid water and then evaporates into water vapor. These changes from one phase to another are referred to as phase changes .      We may also have noticed that the temperature of water doesn't change during boiling. The temperature of water increases up to boiling and then remains constant as it boils. The following diagram illustrates the relationship between temperature and amount of heat needed to change the phases of water. We can see that the temperature increases as heat is added to water within a phase. Adding heat into the water increases the kinetic energy of water molecules within the ice. During the phase change, the added heat doesn't make the molecules move faster, but make them further apart. The heat energy added during the phase change is consumed to overcome intermolecular force of attraction and stored within the material in the form of potential energy of the molecules. Where amount of heat added to the system can be obtained by    and   While cooling process heat is taken out from the system, then latent heat of vaporization becomes latent heat of condensation and latent heat of melting becomes latent heat of fusion. For water, latent heat of melting and latent heat of fusion are same. Similarly, latent heat of vaporization and latent heat of condensation are same but they are not same for many other materials. Phase of matter changes from solid to liquid is called melting or fusion , from solid to gas is called sublimation , from liquid to solid is called freezing , from liquid to gas is called evaporation or boiling, from gas to solid is called deposition , from gas to liquid is called condensation , from plasma state to gaseous state is called recombination , and from gaseous state to plasma state is called ionization .

  "title": "Heat Transfer",
  "body": " Heat Transfer   It is process by which heat transfers from one location to another due to temperature difference. Heat can only flow from high temperature to low temperature. There are three processes involved in heat transfer. They are conduction, convection, and radiation.   Conduction  In this process heat is transferred through stationary matter by physical contact. In microscopic level atoms and molecules are always in random motion at any temperature above absolute zero. When heated these particles (atoms and molecules) gain thermal energy and begin vibrating even higher amplitude knocking the neighboring particles. By doing so they impart some of their energy to their neighboring particles, and so on. Eventually heat is carried away from one end of a substance to another. In conduction, heat carrying particles do not physically move from its place rather they transfer their energy to neighbors when they knock one another. Every time they knock pass some of their energy to next one and returns to their original place. Heat transfers from the burner of a stove through the bottom of a pan to food in the pan is transferred by conduction. Conduction occurs in all states of substances solid, liquid, and gas. In solids, conduction happens due to molecular vibration. In gases and liquids, it is due to collisions and diffusion of the molecules during their random motion.  Consider one end of a metallic bar [ ] of length and area of cross-section is kept at hot temperature and another end is kept at cold temperature , then the amount of heat, transfers through this bar at time can be found experimentally as    combining these all, we get -  where is a proportionality constant, known as coefficient of thermal conduction or conductivity of a material. It is a material property.      In differential form, where is a length of the bar. That is, the rate of heat flow at any point is proportional to the temperature gradient (how fast the temperature is changing with position). The ratio of thickness to the conductivity of a material can be known as R-values . Hence, and the rate of heat flow can be given by     Convection  In this process heat transfer occurs by the actual movement of fluid particles. Convection heat transfer is energy transport due to bulk fluid motion. Convection happens in gases and liquids.      When a fluid is heated, its molecules which are in contact with the hot surface get hot and expand. That is, the fluid above a hot surface expands, becomes less dense, and rises. It carries the thermal energy along when rises up. The relatively cold fluid on the upper surface is heavier and sink down near the heat source. Hence a current of heat cycle develops in the convection process, called convection cycle. The rate of heat flow in convection process is given by where is known as convective heat transfer coefficient, is surface area of fluid receiving heat, and are temperature of hot surface and cold fluid, respectively. The unit of is     Radiation  It is the process in which heat transfer without the need of intervening medium. Heat transfer occurs in this process when electromagnetic waves emitted or absorbed. The warming of the earth surface by the Sun is due to radiation. Heat transfer by this process is the fastest one. All bodies above absolute zero emit thermal radiation. At room temperature the radiation is in the infrared range, wavelengths longer than those of the visible spectrum. In atomic domain, the radiation is caused because of oscillating ions and electrons in a warm solid are accelerating electric charges, such charges radiate. Different substances radiate with different efficiencies. The good radiator of radiation is a good absorber of radiation. A perfect absorber is called a black body (such perfection is not found in nature, but some things are close). Hence a black body is also a perfect radiator. A black body absorbs and emits radiation of all most all frequencies. It was found experimentally that heat energy radiated per unit time per unit surface area of a perfectly black body is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature. This statement is also called Stefan-Boltzmann law . That is,  where is called Stefan-Boltzmann constant and is called emissivity of the object. For a perfect black body If and be the temperatures of the body and its surroundings then, net rate of heat loss, For any particular wavelength and temperature the amount of thermal radiation emitted depends on the emissivity of the object's surface. Emissivity is defined as the ratio of the energy radiated from a material's surface to that radiated from a blackbody at the same temperature and wavelength under the same viewing conditions. It is a dimensionless number between 0 (for a perfect reflector) and 1 (for a perfect emitter). The emissivity of a surface depends not only on the material but also on the nature of the surface . For example, a clean and polished metal surface will have a low emissivity, whereas a roughened and oxidized metal surface will have a high emissivity. The emissivity also depends on the temperature of the surface as well as wavelength and angle.     To calculate temperature, heat transfer, and energy balance in various systems or to understand the transfer of energy (heat) as electromagnetic radiation between objects the following terminologies are very important to know.   Emissive Power  It is defined as the radiant energy emitted per unit time per unit surface area of the body at a particular temperature within a unit wavelength range. Emissive power represents the rate at which an object emits electromagnetic radiation, typically in the form of thermal radiation (infrared radiation) due to its temperature. Emissive power depends on the temperature of the object and its emissivity. Emissivity is a material property that describes how efficiently an object can emit radiation compared to an ideal black body, which has an emissivity of 1. Objects with higher emissivity values emit radiation more effectively.    Absorptive Power  It is defined as the ratio of radiant energy absorbed per unit time per unit surface area of the body to the total energy falling per unit time on the same area at a particular temperature within a unit wavelength range. Absorptive power represents the ability of an object to absorb electromagnetic radiation. It is the complement of reflectivity and is related to how efficiently a material can absorb incoming radiation. Materials with high absorptivity values absorb more radiation and convert it into thermal energy. Absorptivity, like emissivity, is also a material property and varies with wavelength. It is a unitless value between 0 and 1.    Kirchhoff's Law  Kirchhoff has two fundamental principles in the study of thermal radiation and the behavior of materials with regard to electromagnetic radiation. The details of Kirchhoff's law is not a part of discussion here but only taken here for some information. Kirchhoff's first law states that at any temperature, the ratio of the emissive power to the absorptive power for a given wavelength is the same for all bodies and is equal to the emissive power of a perfectly black body.  In other words, this law states that the emissivity ( ) of an object at a particular wavelength is equal to its absorptivity ( ) at that same wavelength. That is, the amount of radiation that an object emits at a specific wavelength is equal to the amount of radiation it absorbs at that same wavelength when the object is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings.  Kirchhoff's second law states that at every temperature and for every wavelength, the emissivity ( ) of a perfect black body is equal to 1. That is, a perfect black body is an idealized object that absorbs all incident radiation and emits radiation at the maximum possible rate for a given temperature. It is often used as a reference to compare the behavior of real objects in radiative heat transfer.      "

It depends on the atomic arrangement of an ideal gas molecule and types of motion it could have in the container. For example, it could have the combination of translation, rotational, and vibrational motion. For a monoatomic gas molecules (like helium, argon), consists of a single atom and can be represented by a point in space [ ]. Such molecule therefore can have only translational motion in any of x-,y-,and z- direction. Thus it can have three independent motion and hence three degrees of freedom. degree of freedom   The molecule of a diatomic gas (like hydrogen, oxygen) is made up of two atoms joined rigidly like a dumbbell [ ]. Such a molecule can translate as well as rotate about any one of the three mutually perpendicular axes. However, rotational inertia about an axis along the rigid rod will be negligible as compared to the other two rotational axes. Hence it can have only two rotational motions and three translational motions. The degrees of freedom for diatomic molecule is therefore five. A triatomic molecule either have linear arrangement of atoms (like ) or tringular arrangement (like ), hence it may have either 7 (3 rotational, 1 vibrational, and 3 translational motions) degrees of freedom or 6 (3 rotational, and 3 translational motions) [ ].

The average kinetic energy of a monoatomic gas molecule is given by   Hence, the average kinetic energy per molecule in each degree of freedom is     Avogadro's Number,  It is the number of molecules in one gram of hydrogen gas or the number of atoms in 12 grams of the carbon-12 isotope. The value of molecules in one mole of carbon-12 atoms. The mole is a base unit in the SI system for an amount of substance. The symbol of mole is [mol]. The mole is defined as the amount of any substance (entity) that contains as many atoms as there are in 12 grams of atom. At standard temperature and pressure (STP, T = 273 K, p = 1 atm) 1 mole of any substance occupies Avogadro's number of molecules. At STP, volume of an ideal gas V=22.4 liter. If we weigh one mole of any substance its comes out to be the molecular weight of that substance in gram . Molecular weight and molar weight are related terms that are often used interchangeably, but they have slightly different meanings. Molecular weight refers to the mass of a single molecule of a substance in atomic mass units (amu) or unified atomic mass units (u). Molar weight, also known as molar mass , refers to the mass of one mole of a substance in unit of grams per mole (g\/mol). The molar mass of a compound is numerically equal to its molecular weight but has units of grams per mole. For example, the molar mass of water ( ) is approximately 18.015 g\/mol, which is the same as its molecular weight (18.015 amu). One mole of water weighs 18.015 g. One mole of ethyl alcohol, , weighs 46.069 g. If we weigh whether one mole of iron or one mole of sulfur they contain the same number of atoms equal to Avogadro's number. This is an important aspect of the mole. Avogadro's number     Atomic Mass Unit, u   amu It is the mass of one hydrogen atom. It is normally a sum of number of protons and neutrons in a nucleus.

There are four laws of thermodynamics.    Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics   isolated system    It defines the temperature and states the thermal equilibrium condition. Thermal equilibrium is a state achieved by two or more systems after being in contact with one another through a diathermic wall. If an object with a higher temperature comes in contact with another object at a lower temperature, it will transfer some of its heat energy to the object at lower temperature till they come to the same temperature. If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they must be in thermal equilibrium with each other. If temperature of object A = temperature of object C and temperature of object B = temperature of object C, then temperature of object A = temperature of object B [ ].    First Law of Thermodynamics               The first law is a consequence of conservation of energy and requires that a system may exchange energy with its surroundings strictly by heat flow or work. Joule has established the equivalence between heat and mechanical work as where W is amount of work done (in joule) on the system, Q is the amount of heat (in calorie) produced in the system, and J is a mechanical equivalent of heat also known as Joule's constant. The value of is . The first law states that when a given amount of work, W is done on a system, an equivalent amount of heat, Q is produced or when a certain amount of heat, Q disappears from the system an equivalent amount of work W is obtained. The equivalence is given by the constant . Heat is thus a form of energy. mechanical equivalent of heat   The Joule apparatus [ ] consisted of a weight suspended by string over a pulley, which in turn was wound around a winding drum. As long as the drum remained stationary, the weight remained at rest. When the drum was released, the weight was set free to fall, and its potential energy began converting to kinetic energy. In the process, the string attached to the weight unwound from the drum, which caused the drum to turn and along with it the paddle wheel attached to it. The rotating paddles agitated the water, causing its temperature to rise. Joule concluded from this experiment that the mechanical energy of the spinning paddle wheel had been converted into heat energy, which raise the temperature of the water. Joule's experiment thus proved the link between potential, kinetic, mechanical, and heat energies. Joule's experiment thus helped establish the principle of conservation of energy. Joul's experiment   Let us consider a system which absorbed amount of heat and does work done while going from initial state to the final state . The final state reached by the system may be achieved by the different paths but the quantity is the same. The quantity is known as the change in internal energy of the system.  Consider a gas cylinder [ ] with frictionless piston placed on a hot bath, then the change in internal energy of the cylinder is given by where is the amount of heat energy absorbed by the gas, and is the amount of work done by the gas in moving its piston from position to . This is the mathematical form of I law of thermodynamics. The I law establishes an exact relation between heat and work. This tells us that it is impossible to get the work from any machine without giving it an equivalent amount of energy in any form .   Quasi static state: A process during which the system only deviates from equilibrium by an infinitessimal amount. This may happen if the gas is allowed to expand or compress very slowly. As the piston compresses the pressure inside the gas remains very nearly uniform at all times during the process. So, the system never deviates significantly from mechanical equilibrium. Quasi static process is also a reversible process. A system is in thermodynamical equilibrium if it has achieved: mechanical equilibrium, chemical equilibrium, and thermal equilibrium. Thermodynamic variables like temperature, pressure etc. can only be used to describe the system that has achieved thermodynamical equilibrium.   "

This law does not tell the limitation and condition of conversion. That is how much heat is converted into work and whether the transformaiton itself can take place or not. The first law does not tell anything about the direction of transformation of energy. It does not indicate whether heat can flow from a cold end to a hot end or not. The first law places no restriction on the direction of a process, and satisfying the first law does not guarantee that the process will occur. In practice, it is not possible to convert the heat energy into an equivalent amount of work. Thus, we need another general principle to identify whether a process can occur or not. The law specifying the condition of transformation of heat into work is called the second law of thermodynamics. The second law of thermodynamics tells the direction of the flow of heat. It also tells that heat energy cannot be completely converted into equivalent work.                        Kelvin-Plank statement of the second law: It is impossible for any device that operates on a cycle to receive heat from a single reservoir and produce a net amount of work [ ]. For heat engine to operate, the working fluid has to exchange heat with heat sink as well with the heat source. A heat engine that violates the Kelvin-Planck statement of the second law cannot be built.   Clausius statement of the second law: It is impossible to construct a device that operates in a cycle and produces no effect other than the transfer of heat from a cold body to a hot body. In other words, a refrigerator will not operate unless an external work is done on its compressor [ ].  The above two statements are equivalent to each other. Consider a refrigerator that transfers heat from a cold to a hot body without having any work done on it [ ], thus violating the Clausius statement. Now, suppose an engine working between the same hot and cold bodies takes in heat from a hot body and gives out heat to the cold body [ ]. The engine does not violate any law by itself, but if the refrigerator and engine combined together [ ], they form a device that takes in heat from the hot body and converts all into work without delivering any to the cold body. This is a violation of Kelvin's statement. Similarly, a violation of the Kelvin's statement leads to violation of the Clausius statement.  "

The initial state of the gas is denoted by point A in the figure 10.25 and it's temperature is the same as that of source . Let the cylinder be placed on the source and allowed to expand so slowly that the temperature remains constant at throughout the expansion while amount of heat is being absorbed by the gas. The final state of the gas is represented by a point B. Because none of the heat goes into changing the temperature of the gas, all of the heat goes into pushing the piston up as the gas expands. Thus all of the heat, is turned into work, That is,      Step 2, Adiabatic Expansion:  adiabatic expansion Now the cylinder is removed from the source and placed on the stand. The gas is then allowed to expand adiabatically with no heat added to the system. The gas continues to expand, and the temperature of the gas drops to the temperature of the cold reservoir, . If the volume of the gas has expanded, and the pressure is constant, then the temperature has to drop to compensate when reaches to a point   The work done in this case is given by  for adiabatic process.         Step 3, Isothermal compression: The cylinder is removed from stand and placed on the sink.

Step 4, Adiabatic compression: In the last step, the cylinder is removed from sink and placed once again on the stand. The gas is compressed adiabatically to the initial state .

The Carnot's engine can not be realized in practice because - (i) The temperature of source and sink can not be kept constant. The body (source) which loses energy its temperature falls gradually and the one (sink) which gains energy its temperature rises gradually, meaning reservoirs of infinite thermal capacity do not exist. (ii) It is a perfectly reversible in action, if the cycle is reversed the working substance will take amount of heat from sink and gives out amount of heat to the source, meaning reversible heat transfers are not possible. (iii) Heat transfer takes place at infinitesimally slow in isothermal process having very small temperature difference between the source and the receiver. On the other hand, in adiabatic process, heat transfer is zero and a very fast process.  "

  "body": " Entropy   A natural tendency of systems is to lose order. When sugar is dissolved in water it becomes more randomized and will not reconstitute itself in the crystalline form again, unless we apply heat energy from outside of the system to evaporate water. When a hot and a cold body are put in contact to each other, heat energy begins to flow from the hot body to the cold body until they reach at thermal equilibrium. Heat will never move back the other way. To move heat from a cold body to a hot body an external work must be done by an external source such as a heat pump. Entropy is a measure of that disorderness. It is a measure of the system's thermal energy per unit temperature that is unavailable for useful work. The concept of entropy provides the direction of spontaneous change for many process. It tells us that which process is allowed and which is completely prohibited even if it can not violet the fundamental law of conservation of energy. An ice cube placed on a hot pan surely melts, while the pan goes cooler. Such a process is called irreversible because no slight change will cause the melted water to turn back into ice while the pan goes hotter. In contrast, a block of ice placed in an ice water bath will either thaw a little more or freeze a little more, depending on whether a small amount of heat is added to or taken out from the system. Such a process is reversible because only an infinitesimal amount of heat is needed to change its direction from progressive freezing to progressive thawing.      Spontaneous change for an irreversible process in an isolated system always proceeds in a direction of increasing entropy. Entropy describes the degradation of energy to perform work. Crystals are more orderly than salt molecules in solution; however, vaporized water is more disordered than liquid water. The process taken as a whole results in a net increase in disorder. The first law of thermodynamics is the conservation of energy and is easy to express quantitatively. The second law explains that heat only flows from a hotter object to a colder one. It measures quantitatively that the efficiency of any reversible engine has to equal that of the Carnot cycle, and any irreversible engine has less efficiency. In the view of measuring the amount of irreversibility Clausius described a parameter, called entropy that doesn't change in a reversible process but always increases in an irreversible one.  The total work done by the gas is the area of the curve ABCD. Hence the work done must be just the difference between the heat supplied at and that dumped at Now the heat supplied along the initial hot isothermal path AB is equal to the work done along that curve, and the heat dumped into the cold reservoir along CD is   The difference between these two is the net work output. This can be simplified using the adiabatic equations for the other two sides of the cycle: and On dividing of these two equations, we get - and using that in the preceding equation for    So for the Carnot cycle the ratio of heat supplied to heat dumped is just the ratio of the absolute temperatures. If we draw many isotherms and many adiabatics curve, then we can find in general that This quantity is a definite thermal property of the working substance. During adiabatic change, there is no transfer of heat so this quantity is zero. Hence that thermal property of the substance which remains constant during an adiabatic change is termed as entropy .  Now let see what happen if we take the path ADCBA. The amount of heat absorbed at temperature when the gas passes from the state A to the state B remains constant even if a path other than the isotherm AB is followed. Now starting from the point A in reverse direction, let the path AD, DC, and CB be followed. Along the adiabatics AD and CB the quantity is zero and the quantity along the isothermal DC But we know that Hence the quantity is independent of the manner of transformation, i.e., the entropy is a definite function of the thermal state of a body and is not affected in any way by the manner in which the particular state is reached. In other words, entropy is a definite physical entity like pressure, volume, temperature, or internal energy but there is nothing physical to represent it . Entropy can not be felt like pressure or temperature. Further, we can not measure the absolute entropy of a substance in any situation, we can only measure the change in entropy as the substance moves from one state to another. Entropy is denoted by a letter, .  Change of entropy = heat energy\/temperature  or, Change of entropy Temperature = Heat Energy.  That is the dimension of heat energy is same as that of the product of entropy and temperature. If we compare, gravitational potential energy mass height with the above expression then it seems like, entropy bears to heat motion in the same fashion as mass bears to linear motion. Hence entropy is also known as a thermal inertia. The second law of thermodynamics can be stated in terms of entropy. The total entropy of the universe is continually increasing because all natural process is irreversible and entropy increases in irreversible process where as there is no change in entropy in the reversible process. But reversible process barely happen in the universe.  Differential form of change of entropy, for reversible path.  Integral form for reversible path.    Principle of increase of entropy:  According to this principle, entropy of the universe always increases for any irreversible process, or remains constant for a reversible process.   Change of entropy of the universe due to reversible process: Consider a Carnot cycle in isothermal expansion. The increase of entropy of the working substance is equal to The decrease of entropy of the source is equal to Thus the net change of entropy of universe during a reversible isothermal process is zero . There is no change of entropy during adiabatic process. Similarly, the decrease of entropy of the working substance during isothermal compression is the increases of entropy of the sink during isothermal compression is Therefore, net change of entropy of the universe is zero. Now take the entire Carnot cycle at once, then loss of entropy of the source (surrounding) is and gains of entropy of the sink (surrounding) is , hence the net change of entropy of the universe,  The entropy of the whole system remains constant.   Change of entropy of the universe due to irreversible process: Consider a heat transfer in conduction process. It is an irreversible process. Let a quantity be transferred from a hot body A at a temperature to a cold body B at temperature The loss of entropy of A is and the gain of entropy of B is Thus the net change in entropy is Since . Therefore the entropy of the system as a whole increase during this process. The entropy of the universe increases in the irreversible process.      Principle of degradation of entropy:  It states that the available energy of the universe is tending towards zero. From the second law whenever an irreversible process takes place, a certain quantity of energy of the universe is converted from a form in which it is unavailable for work. In Carnot engine, is the heat that is taken from a source and is the amount of heat given to the sink. The difference of this heat is converted into work and is called the available energy . Available energy is therefore,  Thus the lower the temperature of the sink, the greater will be the available energy.  Now consider an irreversible process in which heat Q is transferred from hot body at temperature to a cold body at temperature Suppose is the lowest available temperature in the system, then available energy to start with is After transfer it becomes Hence the loss available energy in the process of transformation is  Since is increasing in irreversible process available energy is decreasing. All natural process are irreversible the available energy of the universe is continually decreasing. When a state of maximum entropy of the universe is reached there would be no available energy to do any work, this condition is called the heat-death .   "

  "body": " Entropy and Probability  Entropy is intimately connected with the probability. If you toss four pennies, then it has very less chance that all four will land heads up. It is six times more likely to get two heads and two tails up. The two heads - two tails state is the most likely, shows the most disorder, and has the highest entropy. Four heads is less likely, has the most order, and the lowest entropy. If you tossed more coins, it would be even less likely that they'd all land heads up, and even more likely that you'd end up with close to the same number of heads as tails.  Let S be entropy and be the maximum probability of the system in a definite state, then we can write Now consider and are the entropies of the two system then total entropy of the combined system will be entropy is an additive quantity. The probability of a composite system is equal to the product of the probabilities of the individual system. That is, Therefore,  Differentiating eqn. with respect to , keeping constant, we get - Again differentiating this eqn. with respect to keeping by constant, we get - Dividing eqns. and , we get -  So that Integrating these expressions, we get -  also,  In general,  Where C is a constant of integration which can be determined by initial conditions. In case of a perfect order, and , then  Hence the microscopic definition of entropy is given by Where for N number of molecules of gas and is Boltzmann constant.  "

This is sometimes called the third law of thermodynamics. The efficiency of Carnot engine, If  i.e., efficient. It means if the temperature of the sink be zero, then complete conversion of heat into work is possible. But further lowering of temperature if it is already sufficiently low is not easy.

Therefore, the total number of microstates for two particles is For each of these states the third particle cab be in any one of states, so Generalizing to N particles gives,   For one mole of gas, there are molecules, so the above equation becomes,   Since then for one mole,        Yes, entropy of the universe increases.        Calculate the change in entropy of 1 g of ice at is concerted into steam at . Latent heat of fusion = 80 cal\/g, latent heat of vaporization = 540 cal\/g, and specific heat capacity of water is       When ice melts to water at then change in entropy,    When water is heated from to then change in entropy,    When water is converted into steam at then change in entropy,  Hence the total change in entropy when one gram of ice at is converted into steam at is         Calculate the change in entropy when 1 kg of water at is mixed with 1 kg of water at     If t be the final temperature of mixture then, heat lost by 1 kg of water at and heat gained by 1 kg of water at From the principle of calorimetry,  Heat lost = Heat gained. Therefore,  Now increase in entropy of 1kg of water in heating from to is  Decrease in entropy of 1kg of water in cooling from to is  Therefore the net increase in entropy of the system = 168-144 = 24 cal\/K.
