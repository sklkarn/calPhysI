<div class="para">Definitions: A <dfn class="terminology">meter</dfn> is the length of the path traveled by light in vacuum during a time interval of <span class="process-math">\(1/299,792,458\)</span> second. <dfn class="terminology">Kilogram</dfn> is the mass of a platinum-iridium alloy cylinder stored in the International Bureau of Weights and Measures at Saint-Cloud, France.  A <dfn class="terminology">second</dfn> is the time that elapses during <span class="process-math">\(9192631770\)</span> cycles of a cesium-133 atomic clock. An <dfn class="terminology">ampere</dfn> is the current which would produce a force <span class="process-math">\(2\times 10^{-7}\)</span> Newton per meter if passes through two negligibly thin straight parallel conductors of infinite length when placed at 1 meter apart in vacuum. <dfn class="terminology">Kelvin</dfn> is a temperature which defines the triple point of water as 273.16 K. A <dfn class="terminology">mole</dfn> is the amount of substance that contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in exactly 12 grams of carbon-12 isotope. One mole of anything is equal to Avogadro’s number. <dfn class="terminology">Candela</dfn> is the intensity of a light source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency <span class="process-math">\(540\times 10^{12}\)</span> hertz and has a radiant intensity <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{683}\)</span> watt per steradian in the same direction. <dfn class="terminology">Radian</dfn> is the ratio of length of arc <span class="process-math">\(\,ds\)</span> to the radius <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> of a circle [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig1a.html" title="Figure 1.1.2.(a)">Figure 1.1.2.(a)</a>]. <dfn class="terminology">Sterad</dfn> is the ratio of the intercepted area <span class="process-math">\(\,dA\)</span> of the spherical surface, described about the apex O as the center, to the square of its radius <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig1b.html" title="Figure 1.1.2.(b)">Figure 1.1.2.(b)</a>].</div>
