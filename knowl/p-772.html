<dfn class="terminology">Stable equilibrium:</dfn> The body is said to be in stable equilibrium if its center of gravity lies below lowest possible position. A funnel standing vertically on its base on the table is in stable equilibrium [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/funnel1.html" title="Figure 9.1.1.(a)">Figure 9.1.1.(a)</a>]. If the funnel is tilted a little bit against any side and then allowed to fall, it will come back to its original position. When the funnel is tilted against any side its center of gravity is raised [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/funnel1a.html" title="Figure 9.1.1.(b)">Figure 9.1.1.(b)</a>]. The line of action of weight passes through the base of the funnel. As long as the line of action of weight remains inside the base area funnel will come back to the original position. A torque due to weight of the funnel brings it back to the original position. For the funnel to tip over the line of action of the weight arrow will have to form a clockwise moment (or to pass outside the point of support). The funnel needs to have been pushed a lot for tip over. Some examples of stable equilibrium are bodies lying on the floor such as chair, table, book, etc. If a system in stable equilibrium is disturbed slightly, it oscillates around that state first but eventually settles down in exactly the same position as it started [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/funnel1b.html" title="Figure 9.1.1.(c)">Figure 9.1.1.(c)</a>]. It does this because its center of gravity is already at the lowest possible position.</div>
