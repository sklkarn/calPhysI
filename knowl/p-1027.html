<div class="para">If we observe the flow of water in a river flowing continuously and smoothly, we will be able to notice that water near the edge of the river flows slower than the water flowing near the middle of the river. When a fluid is flowing past a stationary wall, the fluid right close to the wall is almost at rest but the fluid away from the wall flows with relatively higher speed. So a velocity gradient exists between layers in fluid flow. This is due to adhesive, cohesive, and frictional forces acting between adjacent layers of the fluid. The <em class="emphasis">velocity gradient</em> (i.e., the change in speed with distances) is a characteristic of the fluid. This is used to define the coefficient of viscosity <span class="process-math">\(\eta.\)</span> We limit our discussion here only on laminar flow of liquid.</div>
