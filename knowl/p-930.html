<div class="para">When a tangential force is applied on one of the faces of any material keeping opposite face fixed, it deforms its shape. Hence from Hook’s law, shear stress <span class="process-math">\(\propto\)</span> shear strain. The elastic property of a body that causes the shape of the body to be changed when a stress is applied is called shear stress. The angle of shear, which is a measure of how much the body’s shape has been deformed is called shear strain. When the shear stress is removed the body returns to its original shape.</div>
