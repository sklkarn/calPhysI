<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Normally, substances expand on heating and contract on cooling. Water exists in three phases solid, liquid, and gas. At temperatures below <span class="process-math">\(0^{o}C,\)</span> water exists as a solid ice, occupying a bigger volume. When heated, it expands like normal solid up to <span class="process-math">\(0^{o}C.\)</span> It begins melting at <span class="process-math">\(0^{o}C\)</span> to liquid water without any change in temperature. Melting is accompanied by a decrease in its volume by about <span class="process-math">\(8\%\text{.}\)</span> As temperature increases above <span class="process-math">\(0^{o}C,\)</span> water contracts further up to <span class="process-math">\(4^{o}C\)</span> and occupies the minimum volume at <span class="process-math">\(4^{o}C\text{.}\)</span> Therefore water has maximum density at <span class="process-math">\(4^{o}C\)</span> which is about <span class="process-math">\(1 \,g/cm^{3}.\)</span> Above <span class="process-math">\(4^{o}C\text{,}\)</span> water expands like any other liquid. This behavior of water is described as anomalous, unusual, irregular, or peculiar behavior of water. The importance of anomalous properties of water can be summarized as:</div>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><div class="para">During cold weather, the temperature of lakes drops and water contracts, becomes denser and sinks. A circulation of water is thus set up until all the water attain maximum density i.e. at <span class="process-math">\(4^{o}C\text{.}\)</span> If further cooling occurs (below <span class="process-math">\(4^{o}C\)</span>), then any water below <span class="process-math">\(4^{o}C\)</span> will stay at the top due to its lower density.  At <span class="process-math">\(0^{o}C,\)</span> ice forms on top and this acts as an insulator to the layers below. Hence the relatively warm water underneath ice layer can help sustain aquatic life.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Ice has a slightly lower density than that of water and hence it floats with a small portion above the water surface. The rest and a larger portion of the ice rests under water. This is called an iceberg. Icebergs pose a great danger to ships as the submerged parts cannot be seen easily by navigators.</div></li>
