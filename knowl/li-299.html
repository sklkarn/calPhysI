<div class="para">Newtonâ€™s third law provides the property of force which states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Meaning, force always comes in pair. If an object <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> applies the action force on object <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> then the object <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> applies the reaction force on the object <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> These pair of forces always act on two different objects. For example, if action force is acting on object B then reaction force must be acting on the object A.</div>

<div class="para">If you stand on a weighing scale, your weight push the scale down with a force equal to your weight, then the scale applies the reaction force on you equal to your weight as a normal force. Remember that even if weight and normal force are equal they are not always equal and they are completely different forces. You get a normal force only when you are in contact with the other surface but you have the weight even if you are above the surface (while jumping) of anything. Suppose you are pushing the book against a wall, so that it does not fall. In that case, the book pushes against the wall and the wall pushes back. This interaction is the normal force and acts on both the book and the wall. None of these forces were equal to the gravitational force or weight of the book.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="subsec-Nlaw_motion.html#li-299" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
