<div class="para">Science is a systematic and brief study of nature. It gathers knowledge on the basis of testable explanations. It is constantly changing and evolving based on the new facts and discoveries. It is divided into two basic parts, living science and non-living science. Living science (also known as Biology) is further divided into two parts, Botany (plant science) and Zoology (animal science). Non-living science (also known as Physical Science) is also divided into two parts, Physics and Chemistry. Physics is the most fundamental science of nature. The word physics is taken from Greek word ’physis’ meaning nature. Physics deals with the properties of matter and universe. Chemistry deals with the constituents of matter. Physics is also classified into two parts, classical physics and modern physics. Classical physics roughly deals with the macroscopic world anything larger than atomic size and moving with relatively low speed. It is governed by  Newtonian mechanics, Maxwell’s equations, and thermodynamical principles. Modern physics on the other hand is governed by quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and relativity. It explains that the matter and energy are alternate forms of one another. In general physics is divided into many branches such as mechanics, thermodynamics, electrodynamics, acoustics, optics, relativity, nuclear physics, and astrophysics.</div>
