<dfn class="terminology">Neutral equilibrium:</dfn>  The body is said to be in neutral equilibrium if the center of gravity of a body is at optimal position it is neither lowered nor is raised up. The object with lower center of gravity is more stable than the one with the higher center of gravity. A funnel lying horizontally on its side at rest on the surface of a table [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/funnel3.html" title="Figure 9.1.3.(a)">Figure 9.1.3.(a)</a>] is in natural equilibrium. If a funnel is pushed slightly to roll, it will neither come back to its original position nor it will roll forward rather it will remain at rest. If the funnel is rolled, its center of gravity is neither raised nor lowered [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/funnel3a.html" title="Figure 9.1.3.(b)">Figure 9.1.3.(b)</a>]. This means that its center of gravity  is at the same height as before. A neutral system is one where the center of gravity of the system is always at the same level. If it has been disturbed slightly it will therefore settle in the new position without a need to move further on or to move back [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/funnel3b.html" title="Figure 9.1.3.(c)">Figure 9.1.3.(c)</a>]. For example, a rolling ball lying on the table.</div>
