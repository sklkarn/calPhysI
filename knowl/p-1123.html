<div class="para">Heat absorbed or released by the material during phase change is called latent heat. There is no temperature change during a phase change hence this energy is hidden from temperature scale. The energy dissipated or released during phase change is in adjustment of particles potential energy in the bonds. Hence the amount of heat <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> during phase change is proportional to the mass of a material. That is,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
Q\propto m
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\therefore\quad  Q  =  m  L
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">where <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is a latent heat during phase change. It is also a material property. The latent (hidden) heat of fusion for water at <span class="process-math">\(0^{o}C\)</span> is approximately <span class="process-math">\(334 \,joules/g\)</span> (79.7 calories/g), and the latent heat of vaporization at <span class="process-math">\(100^{o}C\)</span> is about 2,230 joules per gram (or, 533 calories per gram) .</div>
