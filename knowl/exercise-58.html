<div class="para">A ball is kicked at an angle <span class="process-math">\(\theta = 45^{o}\text{.}\)</span> It is intended that the ball lands in the back of a moving truck which has a trunk of length L = 2.5 m. If the initial horizontal distance from the back of the truck to the ball, at the instant of the kick, is <span class="process-math">\(d_{o} = 5 m\text{,}\)</span> and the truck moves directly away from the ball at velocity <span class="process-math">\(v = 9 m/s\)</span> (as shown), what is the maximum and minimum velocity <span class="process-math">\(v_{o}\)</span> so that the ball lands in the trunk. Assume that the initial height of the ball is equal to the height of the ball at the instant it begins to enter the trunk.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="ex_thirdB.html#exercise-58" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
