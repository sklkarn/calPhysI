<div class="para">Kinetic theory of matter is developed to explain the nature of heat and the motion of particles associated with heat energy. According to this theory, every substance is composed of large number of very tiny particles called <dfn class="terminology">molecules</dfn>. These molecules are always in random motion with all possible velocities which increases with the increase of temperature. On this basis, in solids, molecules are very closely packed and attract each other with a large cohesive force. They cannot move freely but can vibrate about their mean positions. This explains the definite size and shape of solids. In liquids, the molecules are farther apart than in solids and attract each other with a comparatively  smaller cohesive force. This force does not allow them to escape the liquids however, they can move freely anywhere within the liquids. This explains why a liquid has a definite size (volume) but no shape of its own. In gases, the molecules are very far away from each other than in solids and liquids and have negligibly small force of attraction between them. Hence they can move freely anywhere within the available space. This explains why a gas has no definite shape and size.</div>
