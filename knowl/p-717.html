<div class="para">Gravitation is a fundamental force of nature that governs the attraction between objects with mass. It is one of the four fundamental forces in the universe, alongside electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force. Gravitation is responsible for many aspects of the motion and behavior of celestial bodies, from the way planets orbit the Sun to the way galaxies interact with each other. It is a universal force that acts on all objects with mass, regardless of their size or distance from each other. It is not limited to just the Earth but extends throughout the entire universe.</div>
