<div class="para">Spontaneous change for an irreversible process in an isolated system always proceeds in a direction of increasing entropy. Entropy describes the degradation of energy to perform work. Crystals are more orderly than salt molecules in solution; however, vaporized water is  more disordered than liquid water. The process taken as a whole results in a net increase in disorder. The first law of thermodynamics is the conservation of energy and is easy to express quantitatively. The second law explains that heat only flows from a hotter object to a colder one. It measures quantitatively that the efficiency of any reversible engine has to equal that of the Carnot cycle, and any irreversible engine has less efficiency. In the view of measuring the amount of irreversibility Clausius described a parameter, called <em class="emphasis">entropy</em> that doesnâ€™t change in a reversible process but always increases in an irreversible one.</div>
