<div class="para">The motion of fluids is a complicated process but here our discussion will concentrate on ideal fluids’ and its motion. Ideal fluids are  incompressible, non-viscous (no internal friction between the fluids’ layer), and have laminar flow  motion. In laminar flow fluid flows with the steady motion or streamline motion. Laminar flow occurs when the fluid flows in infinitesimal parallel layers with no disruption (i.e., no swirls or no eddies) between them. In such flow fluid follows the same velocity and direction at every points of its motion. There are another type of fluid motion called turbulent flows. In such flow fluid moves with changing velocities and directions on every point of its path. Reynolds number is used to distinguish the transition between laminar and turbulent flows. We limit our studies here to turbulent and <dfn class="terminology">Reynold’s number</dfn>.</div>
