<div class="para">Measurement is a base of science. In every measurement there is some  uncertainty. This uncertainty  is  called an error. The concept of errors can be understood by knowing the terms accuracy and precision. Accuracy refers to how closely a measured value agrees with the correct (true) value. Precision refers to how closely individual measurements agree with each other. For example, suppose the true value of a certain length is near 5.678 cm. In one experiment, the measured value is found to be  5.5 cm by using a measuring instrument of resolution 0.1 cm, while  in  another  experiment, the length is determined to be 5.38 cm by using a measuring device of greater resolution, say 0.01 cm. The first measurement is  more  accurate (as it  is closer to the true value) but less precise (as its resolution  is  only  0.1  cm),  while  the second  measurement is less  accurate but more  precise.  Thus  every  measurement is approximate due to errors in measurement. In general, the  errors can be classified as (a) systematic errors and (b) random errors. The errors that appear due to faulty instruments or imperfact instrumental design are known as systematic errors. It is a repeatable error in the measurement. The systematic errors are</div>
