<div class="para">The property of a material by virtue of which it regains its original shape and size after removal of deforming force is known as elasticity. The elastic properties of matter are a manifestation of the molecular forces that hold solids together. Elasticity is a fundamental concept in the study of the mechanical behavior of solids and is related to the deformation and restoration of materials when subjected to stress or strain. A regular, periodically repeated, three-dimensional array of the atoms or molecules comprising the solid are called <dfn class="terminology">lattice structure</dfn>.</div>
