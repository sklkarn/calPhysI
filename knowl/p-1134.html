<div class="para">In this process heat is transferred through stationary matter by physical contact. In microscopic level atoms and molecules are always in random motion at any temperature above absolute zero. When heated these particles (atoms and molecules) gain thermal energy and begin vibrating even higher amplitude knocking the neighboring particles. By doing so they impart some of their energy to their neighboring particles, and so on. Eventually heat is carried away from  one end of a substance to another. In conduction, heat carrying  particles do not physically move from its place rather they  transfer their energy to neighbors when they knock one another. Every time they knock pass some of their energy to next one and returns to their original place. Heat transfers from the burner of a stove through the bottom of a pan to food in the pan is transferred by conduction. Conduction occurs in all states of substances solid, liquid, and gas. In solids, conduction happens due to molecular vibration. In gases and liquids, it is due to collisions and diffusion of the molecules during their random motion.</div>
