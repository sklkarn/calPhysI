<body class="ignore-math"><div class="fn">The zero point is so chosen that it could be infinitely far away. Such as at infinity, at the center of the earth, at sea level, at the floor, at the table top, or at any other point. This is because only potential energy differences between two positions are physically measurable and cannot depend on the a rbitrary choice of the zero point.</div></body>
