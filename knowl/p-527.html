<div class="para">The capacity of doing work is known as energy. It is a scalar quantity and itâ€™s unit in SI system is Joule. Energy exists in many different forms, such as thermal energy, sound energy, electrical energy, magnetic energy, gravitational energy, chemical energy, mechanical energy, etc. The energy  associated with the motion and position of an object is termed as mechanical energy. We focus our understanding here in mechanical energy. Mechanical energy is of two types, kinetic energy and potential energy. The kinetic energy is associated with the motion of the object and potential energy is associated with the position  of the object with respect to some other object. For example: elastic potential energy due to a spring force, gravitational potential energy due to gravity, etc. The sum of kinetic and potential energy gives the total mechanical energy of the object.</div>
