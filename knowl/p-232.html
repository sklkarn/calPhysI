<div class="para">The angle subtends by an object when rotating in a circular path about an axis is called the angular displacement. In a 2D space, angular displacement describes a rotation of an object and is a simply number, a scalar. However, in 3D space, direction of the axis of rotation of an object need to be specified and hence it behaves as a vector. The direction of the vector is the direction of the axis of rotation, and the magnitude is how big the rotation was. Since angular displacement does not follow all the vectors rule in 2 dimension hence it is not taken as a vector quantity. For angular rotation in 2D,</div>

You rotate first pencil to <span class="process-math">\(90^{o}\)</span> about vertical axis so that tip facing left side, then rotate it again by <span class="process-math">\(90^{o}\)</span> about a horizontal axis so that its tip facing upward. Now rotate the second pencil by <span class="process-math">\(90^{o}\)</span> about the horizontal axis so that its tip facing upward and again rotate it by <span class="process-math">\(90^{o}\)</span> about a another horizontal axis so that tip facing left. Now you can see that they have different orientations, not parallel any more.</div>
