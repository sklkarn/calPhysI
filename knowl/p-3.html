<div class="para">General physics is a calculus-based introductory physics book. This book is a concise form of my lecture notes that I have been delivering in my introductory level physics courses for many years. This text is not a replacement of any textbook that has been recommended by the instructor but designed to provide additional materials as my personal teaching activities in calculus-based physics. It is intended to support introductory level materials at a rapid and an efficient way. Students who want to use this text assume to have a prerequisite knowledge of some basic mathematical skills such as geometry, algebra, trigonometry, and some advanced mathematical tools such as a differential and integral calculus.</div>
