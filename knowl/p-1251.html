<div class="para">That is the dimension of heat energy is same as that of the product of entropy and temperature. If we compare, gravitational potential energy <span class="process-math">\(\propto\)</span> mass <span class="process-math">\(\times\)</span> height with the above expression then it seems like, entropy bears to heat motion in the same fashion as mass bears to linear motion. Hence entropy is also known as a thermal inertia. The second law of thermodynamics can be stated in terms of entropy. The total entropy of the universe is continually increasing because all natural process is irreversible and entropy increases in irreversible process where as there is no change in entropy in the reversible process. But reversible process barely happen in the universe.</div>
