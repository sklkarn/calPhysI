<div class="para">There are varieties of thermometers in existence. Based on the phases of materials used in thermometer they are solid state thermometer, liquid thermometer, and gas thermometer. Many physical properties of materials change significantly with temperature can be used as the basis for constructing thermometers. Solid  thermometer works upon the principle that resistances of solid objects are proportional to changes in its temperature. Liquid thermometer works upon the principle that expansion in liquid volume are proportional to changes in its temperature. Gas thermometer works upon the principle that changes in gas pressure are proportional to changes in gas temperature. Here  mainly discussed about liquid thermometer. Liquid thermometers, such as mercury-in-glass or alcohol thermometers, have been widely used for temperature measurement for many years. However, due to toxic effect of mercury for living being mercury thermometers are not much in use these days. The  different calibration process of thermometers produces different types of temperature scales. They are Centigrade (Celsius) scale [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/therm1.html" title="Figure 10.1.1.(a)">Figure 10.1.1.(a)</a>], Fahrenheit scale[<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/therm2.html" title="Figure 10.1.1.(b)">Figure 10.1.1.(b)</a>], and Kelvin scale [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/therm3.html" title="Figure 10.1.1.(c)">Figure 10.1.1.(c)</a>]. There are some other types of scales like Rankine’s or Reamer’s thermometers available but they are almost obsolete. A centigrade thermometer has 100 divisions between the freezing point (0 degree Celsius) and the boiling point (100 degree Celsius) of water. Swedish astronomer Andres Celsius is credited for its development.  A temperature of 76 degree Celsius is abbreviated as <span class="process-math">\(76^{o}C.\)</span> The Celsius scale is the most widely accepted temperature scale in the world except the United States. In Fahrenheit thermometer, there are 180 divisions between the freezing point (32 degree Fahrenheit) and the boiling point (212 degree Fahrenheit) of water. German physicist Daniel Fahrenheit is credited for its development. It is the first modern thermometer developed in 1714. A temperature of 76 degree Fahrenheit is abbreviated as <span class="process-math">\(76^{o}F.\)</span>
