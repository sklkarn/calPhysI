<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">An object moving in a circular path is called a circular motion. In a uniform circular motion the direction of velocity is constantly changing but its magnitude remains constant. This constantly changing velocity vector produces the acceleration on an object which is pointed towards the center of a circle, called a centripetal acceleration. For this acceleration to happen there must exists a resultant force which is called the centripetal force. The centripetal force is not a physical force like frictional force, normal force, or gravity force, etc. it does not act on a body but it makes the body to rotate in a circle.  This is a <dfn class="terminology">resulting force</dfn> rather than a <dfn class="terminology">causing force</dfn> like tension in a string, normal force acting on a body, frictional force between the surfaces of contact, and all fundamental forces. It is an unbalanced force. [<em class="alert">Note</em> that the causing force always comes in pair.] If <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is the radius of the path, and <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is the time period, the time it takes to complete a circle, then its speed (linear) is given by</div>

<div class="para">For a uniform circular motion centripetal acceleration <span class="process-math">\(a_{c} = a_{r}\text{,}\)</span> is pointed along the radial direction towards its center and the tangential acceleration <span class="process-math">\(a_{t}\)</span> is zero. For a non-uniform circular motion there is still a radial acceleration <span class="process-math">\(a_{c} = a_{r}\)</span> but the tangential acceleration <span class="process-math">\(a_{t}\)</span> is non-zero pointed along the direction of velocity. If the centripetal force vanishes, the object flies off at a tangent to the circle.</div>
