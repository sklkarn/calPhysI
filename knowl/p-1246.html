<div class="para">Heat flows from hot body to cold body naturally. The reverse process, however, cannot occur by itself. To transfer heat from a low temperature region to a high temperature requires special devices called refrigerators or heat pump. Heat pumps transfer heat from a low temperature medium to a high temperature one. Refrigerators and heat pumps are essentially the same devices; they differ in their objectives only. Refrigerator is to maintain the refrigerated space at a low temperature. On the other hand, a heat pump absorbs heat from a low temperature source and supplies the heat to a warmer medium. Heat pumps and refrigerators are heat engine working in backward direction. They transfer heat from cold to hot.</div>
