<div class="para">To calculate temperature, heat transfer, and energy balance in various systems or to understand the transfer of energy (heat) as electromagnetic radiation between objects the following terminologies are very important to know.</div>
<ol class="decimal">

<span class="heading"><span class="title"><dfn class="terminology">Emissive Power</dfn>.</span></span><div class="para">It is defined as the radiant energy emitted per unit time per unit surface area of the body at a particular temperature within a unit wavelength range. Emissive power represents the rate at which an object emits electromagnetic radiation, typically in the form of thermal radiation (infrared radiation) due to its temperature. Emissive power depends on the temperature of the object and its emissivity. Emissivity is a material property that describes how efficiently an object can emit radiation compared to an ideal black body, which has an emissivity of 1. Objects with higher emissivity values emit radiation more effectively.</div>
</li>

<span class="heading"><span class="title"><dfn class="terminology">Absorptive Power</dfn>.</span></span><div class="para">It is defined as the ratio of radiant energy absorbed per unit time per unit surface area of the body to the total energy falling per unit time on the same area at a particular temperature within a unit wavelength range. Absorptive power represents the ability of an object to absorb electromagnetic radiation. It is the complement of reflectivity and is related to how efficiently a material can absorb incoming radiation. Materials with high absorptivity values absorb more radiation and convert it into thermal energy. Absorptivity, like emissivity, is also a material property and varies with wavelength. It is a unitless value between 0 and 1.</div>

<span class="heading"><span class="title"><dfn class="terminology">Kirchhoff’s Law</dfn>.</span></span><div class="para">Kirchhoff has two fundamental principles in the study of thermal radiation and the behavior of materials with regard to electromagnetic radiation. The details of Kirchhoff’s law is not a part of discussion here but only taken here for some information. Kirchhoff’s first law states that at any temperature, the ratio of the emissive power to the absorptive power for a given wavelength is the same for all bodies and is equal to the emissive power of a perfectly black body.</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">In other words, this law states that the emissivity (<span class="process-math">\(\epsilon\)</span>) of an object at a particular wavelength is equal to its absorptivity (<span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span>) at that same wavelength. That is,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\epsilon (\lambda) = \alpha(\lambda)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">the amount of radiation that an object emits at a specific wavelength is equal to the amount of radiation it absorbs at that same wavelength when the object is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings.</div>
</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Kirchhoff’s second law states that at every temperature and for every wavelength, the emissivity (<span class="process-math">\(\epsilon\)</span>) of a perfect black body is equal to 1. That is,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\epsilon (\lambda) =1
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">a perfect black body is an idealized object that absorbs all incident radiation and emits radiation at the maximum possible rate for a given temperature. It is often used as a reference to compare the behavior of real objects in radiative heat transfer.</div>
