<div class="para">To understand viscosity more clearly, let us know about the types of fluids flow. <dfn class="terminology">Laminar flow:</dfn> It is a smooth and continuous flow of the fluid in layers that do not mix. <dfn class="terminology">Turbulent flow:</dfn> It is the eddies and swirls that mix layers of fluid together. In laminar flow layers of fluid flow without mixing and it follows the same velocity and direction at every points of its motion, hence it is also called <em class="emphasis">streamlines motion</em>. In turbulent flow streamlines break up and mix together and the fluid moves with changing velocities and directions on every point of its path. Notice that viscosity causes drag between layers as well as with the fixed surface. An obstruction in the vessel or speeding up fluid velocity above a certain value leads to a turbulent flow.  <em class="emphasis">Reynolds number</em> is used to distinguish the transition between laminar and turbulent flows.</div>
