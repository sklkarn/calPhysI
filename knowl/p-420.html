<dfn class="terminology">Unstable equilibrium:</dfn> The body is said to be in unstable equilibrium if the center of gravity of a body lies above the highest possible position. A funnel standing vertically on its stem on the table [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/funnel2.html" title="Figure 4.11.4.(a)">Figure 4.11.4.(a)</a>] is in unstable equilibrium. If the funnel standing vertically is slightly disturbed from its position it will not come back to its original position rather fall down on the surface of table. when the funnel is slightly disturbed its center of gravity is lowered [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/funnel2a.html" title="Figure 4.11.4.(b)">Figure 4.11.4.(b)</a>]. The line of action of its weight lies outside the base of stem. The torque due to weight of the rod toppled it down. Other examples of unstable equilibrium are vertically standing cylinder and pencil etc. An unstable system moves away from its original equilibrium state when disturbed. It wants to move away from the original position as soon as it has been disturbed [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/funnel2b.html" title="Figure 4.11.4.(c)">Figure 4.11.4.(c)</a>]. It does this because its center of gravity is higher in this state and when disturbed the center of gravity continues to move to a lower position (a more stable one).</div>
