<div class="para">There are several processes in nature which occur always in a particular fashion. For examples, <em class="emphasis">water falls from a high elevation to low elevation,</em> <em class="emphasis">heat flows from high temperature to low temperature</em>, <em class="emphasis">current flows from high electric potential to low electric potential</em>, in diffusion <em class="emphasis">molecules flows from high concentration to low concentration</em>, <em class="emphasis">we grow older not younger</em>, <em class="emphasis">our hair turns gray not black as we go older</em>, and so on. Even in the conversion of mechanical energy into heat energy, for example if you rub your right hand finger on the palm of left hand (mechanical work) you produce a heat but reverse does not seem to happen. Yes, some events can happen in both directions, for example you can heat a gas and you can cool a gas, you expand a gas and compress a gas, etc but even in that processes we can see there are some changes happen in the surroundings. We will discuss those events later in second law of thermodynamics which talks about the directional property of heat energy and its conversion. The conversion of mechanical energy into electrical energy and vice a versa is 100% possible in ideal case but if we want to convert heat energy into mechanical work (energy) then 100% conversion is not possible even in the ideal  case. However, we can convert all of our mechanical energy into heat energy. Hence we can tell that the nature always follows a certain pattern to have some process to occur. Nature obeyes simple and universal laws that can be expressed in the mathematical language. <em class="emphasis">Thermodynamics</em> is thus a fundamental subject of nature that describes the basic laws governing the physical process and its occurrence associated with the transfer of energy and its conversion. It is based on our common experience, observation, and experimentation. It has two parts in observational points of view, that is microscopic view (statistical thermodynamics) and macroscopic view (classical thermodynamics). The characteristic of the over all behavior the system can be sensed in classical thermodynamics. The behavior of system on the basis of its molecular property can be studied in statistical thermodynamics. That is, the classical <em class="emphasis">thermodynamics is an average outcome of statistical thermodynamics</em>. <em class="emphasis">Thermodynamics provides a very important aspects of our life that tells us which process in nature can only occur and which process can not occur.</em>
