<div class="para">To understand the thermodynamical process we need to know about the system and surroundings. The system is the part of the universe being studied, while the surroundings are the rest of the universe that interacts with the system. The <em class="emphasis">system and surroundings</em> are separated by a hypothetical line called a <em class="emphasis">boundary</em>. It may be real or imaginary, for example water in a beaker is separated from rest of the room, then the beaker behaves as a boundary, water as a system, and the rest of the room as surroundings. In other word, a <dfn class="terminology">system</dfn> is a definite amount of matter bounded by a closed surface. Anything outside of this closed surface is called a <dfn class="terminology">surroundings</dfn>. The closed surface is a boundary which separates the system and the surroundings. The boundary may be real or imaginary, it may be fixed, flexible, or distorted. System and surroundings must interact with each other by exchanging energy of any forms. System which can exchange energy and matter both with the surroundings is called <em class="alert">open system</em>. For example, boiling water in an open pot. If the system can exchange only energy but not the matter with its surroundings then system is called a <em class="alert">closed system</em>. For example, a cup of coffee with a lid on it. Some system neither exchange energy nor the matter with its surroundings then it is called an <em class="alert">isolated system</em>. For example, a thermos flask.</div>
