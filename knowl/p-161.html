<div class="para">Motion is the action of changing position of an object over time. It is a relative property. It depends upon the relative position of the observer and the object. A person sitting in a spaceship is at zero velocity relative to the spaceship, but is moving at the same velocity as the spaceship with respect to the ground. The earth is at rest with respect to us, but it is moving about 30 km/s around the sun. Two bicycle riders cycling on a straight road with the same velocity are at rest with respect to each other but are in motion with respect to the observer on the road.</div>
