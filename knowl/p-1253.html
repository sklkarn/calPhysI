<div class="para">Now let see what happen if we take the path ADCBA. The amount of heat absorbed at temperature <span class="process-math">\(T_{h}\)</span> when the gas passes from the state A to the state B remains constant even if a path other than the isotherm AB is followed. Now starting from the point A in reverse direction, let the path AD, DC, and CB be followed. Along the adiabatics AD and CB the quantity <span class="process-math">\(\frac{Q}{T} \)</span> is zero and the quantity along the isothermal DC <span class="process-math">\(=\frac{Q_{c}}{T_{c}}.\)</span> But we know that</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{Q_{c}}{T_{c}}= \frac{Q_{h}}{T_{h}}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Hence the quantity <span class="process-math">\(\int\limits_{i}^{f} \frac{Q}{T}\)</span> is independent of the manner of transformation, i.e., the entropy is a definite function of the thermal state of a body and is not affected in any way by the manner in which the particular state is reached. In other words, <em class="emphasis">entropy is a definite physical entity like pressure, volume, temperature, or internal energy but there is nothing physical to represent it</em>. Entropy can not be felt like pressure or temperature. Further, we can not measure the absolute entropy of a substance in any situation, we can only measure the change in entropy as the substance moves from one state to another. Entropy is denoted by a letter, <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span>
