<div class="para">The work done by a force is defined as the product of component of the force  in the direction of displacement and the magnitude of displacement. Work in physics is different than our daily life work. Suppose you are pushing a rigid brick wall very hard, after some time you get exhausted because you lose your body energy. In our daily life we called this action as a work, but in physics this is not a work because the object did not displace from its position. Hence in physics, whether the force or the displacement is zero, there is no work. Depending upon the angle between the applied force and the displacement, work could be negative, positive, or zero. For example, work done by a frictional force, or work done by a force acting opposite to the motion of object,</div>
