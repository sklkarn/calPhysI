<dfn class="terminology">Quasi static state:</dfn> A process during which the system only deviates from equilibrium by an infinitessimal amount. This may happen if the gas is allowed to expand or compress very slowly. As the piston compresses the pressure inside the gas remains very nearly uniform at all times during the process. So, the system never deviates significantly from mechanical equilibrium. Quasi static process is also a reversible process. A system is in thermodynamical equilibrium if it has achieved: mechanical equilibrium, chemical equilibrium, and thermal equilibrium. Thermodynamic variables like temperature, pressure etc. can only be used to describe the system that has achieved thermodynamical equilibrium.</div>
