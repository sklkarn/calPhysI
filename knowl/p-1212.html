<div class="para">The Joule apparatus [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/jouleexpt.html" title="Figure 10.6.3.(a)">Figure 10.6.3.(a)</a>] consisted of a weight suspended by string over a pulley, which in turn was wound around a winding drum. As long as the drum remained stationary, the weight remained at rest. When the drum was released, the weight was set free to fall, and its potential energy began converting to kinetic energy. In the process, the string attached to the weight unwound from the drum, which caused the drum to turn and along with it the paddle wheel attached to it. The rotating paddles agitated the water, causing its temperature to rise. Joule concluded from this experiment that the mechanical energy of the spinning paddle wheel had been converted into heat energy, which raise the temperature of the water. Joule’s experiment thus proved the link between potential, kinetic, mechanical, and heat energies. Joule’s experiment thus helped establish the principle of conservation of energy. </div>
