<div class="para">It is the number of molecules in one gram of hydrogen gas or the number of atoms in 12 grams of the carbon-12 isotope. The value of <span class="process-math">\(N_{A} = 6.022 \times 10^{23}\)</span> molecules in one mole of carbon-12 atoms. The mole is a base unit in the SI system for an amount of substance. The symbol of mole is [mol]. The mole is defined as the amount of any substance (entity) that contains as many atoms as there are in 12 grams of <span class="process-math">\(C-12\)</span> atom. At standard temperature and pressure (STP, T = 273 K, p = 1 atm) 1 mole of any substance occupies Avogadro’s number of molecules. At STP, volume of an ideal gas V=22.4 liter. If we weigh one mole of any substance its comes out to be the molecular weight of that substance in gram <a href="subsec-equip_law.html#subsubsec-amu" class="internal" title="Subsubsection 10.5.3.2: Atomic Mass Unit, u">Subsubsection 10.5.3.2</a>. <details class="ptx-footnote" aria-live="polite" id="subsubsec-avagdrs-2-4"><summary class="ptx-footnote__number" title="Footnote 10.5.1"><sup> 1 </sup></summary><div class="ptx-footnote__contents" id="subsubsec-avagdrs-2-4">Molecular weight and molar weight are related terms that are often used interchangeably, but they have slightly different meanings. Molecular weight refers to the mass of a single molecule of a substance in atomic mass units (amu) or unified atomic mass units (u). Molar weight, also known as <dfn class="terminology">molar mass</dfn>, refers to the mass of one mole of a substance in unit of grams per mole (g/mol). The molar mass of a compound is numerically equal to its molecular weight but has units of grams per mole. For example, the molar mass of water (<span class="process-math">\(H_2O\)</span>) is approximately 18.015 g/mol, which is the same as its molecular weight (18.015 amu).</div></details> One mole of water <span class="process-math">\((H_{2}O)\)</span> weighs 18.015 g. One mole of ethyl alcohol, <span class="process-math">\((C_{2}H_{6}O)\text{,}\)</span> weighs 46.069 g. If we weigh whether one mole of iron or one mole of sulfur they contain the same number of atoms equal to Avogadro’s number. This is an important aspect of the mole. </div>
