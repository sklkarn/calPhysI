<div class="para">When an object is placed on the surface of an inclined plane and the angle of inclination is being increased slowly then at a particular angle the object just begins to slide, this angle is known an <dfn class="terminology">angle of repose, <span class="process-math">\(\phi\)</span></dfn>. At the angle of repose static frictional force is balanced by one of the components of weight <span class="process-math">\((mg\sin\theta)\)</span> of the object (see in section statics).</div>

<dfn class="terminology">Force of Gravity:</dfn> This force is acting on any object due to attraction of earth. Near the surface of the earth force of gravity is given by its weight, i.e., <span class="process-math">\(F_{g}=w=mg\text{.}\)</span> Where <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is the acceleration due to gravity and the direction force is acting along the center of the earth. <dfn class="terminology">Normal:</dfn>  This is a force of reaction from the surface where the object is placed. It is always perpendicular to the surface of contact. <dfn class="terminology">Tension:</dfn>  This force is acting between two objects on opposite ends of the string, in the directions to taut string at the points of contact. This force stretches the string along fixed support. It is a pulling force. <dfn class="terminology">Spring force:</dfn> A spring is a special medium that has ability to restore its shape, if  deformed. All materials have elastic property which helps them to restore their shape, if an applied deforming force has been released. From <dfn class="terminology">Hook’s law</dfn> a material (spring) exerts a restoring force that is proportional to a deforming force in opposite direction in which it is stretched or compressed. In mathematical form,</div>

<div class="para">The proportionality constant <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is a measure of the spring’s stiffness, also called an elastic constant. The line of action of this force is parallel to the spring axis, and acts along the opposite direction of the displacement vector. The displacement must be measured from the relaxed (equilibrium) position;  <span class="process-math">\(x = 0\)</span> when the spring is relaxed.</div>
