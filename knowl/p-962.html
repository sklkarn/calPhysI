<div class="para">The branch of physics which deals with the behavior of fluids is known as fluid mechanics. Fluid is a material that can flow. Gasses and liquids are fluids. Like mechanics it has also three parts, viz, fluid statics, fluid kinematics, and fluid dynamics. Hence in this chapter we are going to study the nature of fluid at rest and in motion very briefly for introductory level. It is easier to deal with fluidâ€™s volume, density, and pressure in fluid measurement rather than its mass and weight. For example, we do transaction of any fluids in their volume (liter) not in their mass (kg). Hence we are introducing some of its general properties.</div>
