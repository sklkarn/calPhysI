<div class="para">Capillary is a phenomenon  by which a liquid rises up into a narrow tube (called <em class="emphasis">capillary</em>) above or below its general level. The upper surface of a liquid in a tube is called the <em class="emphasis">meniscus</em>, and the shape of the meniscus depends on the relative strengths of the cohesive and adhesive forces. In liquids such as water, the meniscus is concave, because of high adhesive forces between water and glass molecules. In liquids such as mercury, the meniscus is convex because the molecules of mercury have very strong cohesive forces and weak adhesion to glass. The height to which the water rises depends on the diameter of the tube and the temperature of the water  but not on the angle of tilt of the tube in water. The smaller the diameter, the higher the liquid rises.</div>
