<div class="para">The energy stored in a body due to its position is known as potential energy. If work is done by a force to change the position of a body, then this work is stored in the body at that position in the form of potential energy. The restoring force plays a crucial role to acquire potential energy. For example, a charged particle near or far from another charge;  a squashed or stretched rubber ball, a body above the surface of the earth. The potential energy of the body at any position is the work done against the restoring force in moving the body from the zero point (reference point) to that position. The reference point <a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-4-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.1.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>  (or, the <em class="emphasis">zero point</em>) is the point where potential energy is assumed to be zero. If work has to be done on a body to take it to a new location, then the potential energy increases in the process. If the external force does the work then the potential energy change is negative.</div>
