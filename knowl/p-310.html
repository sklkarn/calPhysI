<div class="para">For a large-scale, electrically neutral objects such as those encountered in this course, the only force that acts at a distance is the gravitational force. All other forces we encounter will be contact forces (mechanical forces) that occur at the boundary of an object where that object physically touches some other object, e.g. <dfn class="terminology">tension, friction, normal, and other applied forces</dfn> [<a href="subsec-friction.html" class="internal" title="Subsection 4.1.3: Friction">SubsectionÂ 4.1.3</a>]. Actually, mechanical force, or chemical force, or any other kinds of force are all electromagnetic forces. In our daily life almost all force we experienced are electromagnetic force except the force of gravity. Strong nuclear forces are very short range and we do not feel them dispite the fact that it is more powerful than the electromagnetic force. Weak forces are also short range and even weaker than electromagnetic force. </div>
