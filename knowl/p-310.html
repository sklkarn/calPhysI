<div class="para">Force is that external agency which when acts on a body, it changes its mechanical state. Meaning it changes its shape or its state of being in rest or in motion, or its  direction of motion. It is also called a push or pull. It is a vector quantity. The branch of physics which deals with the effect of force and motion on an object is called a <dfn class="terminology">mechanics</dfn>. Mechanics has basically three parts, kinematics, statics, and dynamics. The study of motion without knowing the cause (force and energy) of motion is called kinematics. Statics is the physics of stationary objects or an object moving with constant velocity. Dynamics is the physics of moving objects under the action of forces, i.e., <span class="process-math">\(F_{net} \neq 0\)</span> in transnational dynamics, or, <span class="process-math">\(\tau_{net} \neq 0\)</span> in rotational dynamics.</div>
