<div class="para">Pascal’s principle states that pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted equally to every portion of the fluid and the walls of the container. This principle is valid only for an incompressible fluid which is most of the liquid. <dfn class="terminology">Hydraulic press</dfn>  is one of the good examples of Pascal’s principle.  It is a device to lift  heavy objects. It has two cylindrical opening attached the horizontal tube as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/hpress.html" title="Figure 9.1.1">Figure 9.1.1</a>. An incompressible liquid is filled in the device. It works on Pascal’s principle and obeys the conservation of energy. Work done on the a pump (small cylindrical piston) to push it down is equal to the work done by the big piston to lift heavy objects like vehicle, elephant, etc. Let a force <span class="process-math">\(F_{1}\)</span> is applied on one piston to push it to a distance <span class="process-math">\(\,dx_{1} \)</span> then it lifts the weight <span class="process-math">\(F_{2}\)</span> to a distance <span class="process-math">\(\,dx_{2}\)</span> on the other pan attached to the second piston.</div>
