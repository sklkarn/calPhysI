<div class="para">The value of <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> on the surface of the earth does not only vary with the radius of the earth but it is also affected by the rotation of the earth. Any mass rotating in a circular motion needs a centripetal force which is acting towards the center of the circular path. Remember that a centripetal force is not a real force that is acting on a rotating body, but it is the required force that must be applied to keep the body in that rotational motion. Hence the part of gravitational force must be acting on a body to provide a necessary centripetal force to keep that object moving on a circle with the rotation of the earth as shown in figure <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/NLG3.html" title="Figure 6.1.3">FigureÂ 6.1.3</a>.</div>
