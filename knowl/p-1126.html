<div class="para">Heat absorbing capacity of a material is known as specific heat capacity. Suppose we have two marbles at room temperature <span class="process-math">\(T_{o}=25^{o}C\text{,}\)</span> one has mass 1 kg  and another has mass 2 kg. If we want to heat them to <span class="process-math">\(100^{o}C\text{,}\)</span> then from our experience we know that 2 kg marble will take longer than 1 kg marble to reach at the same temperature. Hence, the amount of heat (Q) put into the material is directly proportional to the mass (m) of the material. That is,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
Q \propto m

</div>
<div class="para">Now suppose both of our marbles has a mass of 1 kg each and we want to heat one of them for <span class="process-math">\(T_{1}= 100^{o}C\)</span> and another for temperature <span class="process-math">\(T_{2}= 200^{o}C.\)</span> We can again tell that the marble which has to be heated for <span class="process-math">\(200^{o}C\)</span>  will take longer than the other.

\begin{equation*}
Q \propto \Delta T

<div class="displaymath process-math">

<div class="para">where <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> is a proportionality constant and is called specific heat capacity of the material. It is the properties of a material. Different materials have different specific heat capacities and hence they absorb or release heat differently.</div>
