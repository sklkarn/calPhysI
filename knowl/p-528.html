<div class="para">Collisions, on the other hand, involve the interaction between two or more objects, where they exert forces on each other for a short duration. Collisions can be classified into two main types: elastic and inelastic. In elastic collisions, kinetic energy is conserved, meaning that the total kinetic energy before the collision equals the total kinetic energy after the collision. In contrast, inelastic collisions do not conserve kinetic energy; some of it may be transformed into other forms, such as heat or deformation. The concepts of energy and collision help scientists and engineers analyze and predict the behavior of systems ranging from subatomic particle interactions to celestial bodies in the universe. They provide a foundation for comprehending the dynamics of the physical world and play a crucial role in technological advancements and problem-solving in everyday life.</div>
