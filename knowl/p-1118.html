A partially inflated balloon expands to full size when placed in lukewarm water. A fully inflated balloon begins shrinking when immersed in cold water. Most materials expand on heating and contract on cooling. The physical property of a material due to which a body can change its dimensions with a change in temperature is called a <dfn class="terminology">thermal expansion</dfn>. The expansion in length is called <em class="emphasis">linear expansion</em>, the expansion in area is called <em class="emphasis">superficial expansion</em>, and the expansion in volume is called <em class="emphasis">volumetric expansion.</em> or bulk expansion.</div>
