<div class="para">We may have experienced that pouring a cup of water or milk is much easier than pouring a cup of honey or glycerin. Water or milk is less sticky than honey or glycerin. On this experience, we can say that water like fluid is thinner and honey like fluid is thicker. The property of fluids which makes them flow differently than one another is called viscosity. Water has low viscosity, whereas honey has high viscosity. Actually there exists some kind of friction between the adjacent layers of fluid when they flow. <em class="emphasis">viscosity is an internal friction (or a drag force) between the adjacent layers of fluid as they move past one another.</em> In liquids viscosity arises due to the cohesive forces between their molecules, while in gases it arises due to the collision between their molecules.</div>
