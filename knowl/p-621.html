<div class="para">A collision in which <em class="emphasis">total momentum and total kinetic energy  are conserved</em> before and after the collision is known as elastic collision. That is there is no dissipative force acting during the collision and that all of the kinetic energy of the objects before the collision is still in the form of kinetic energy afterward. Any macroscopic collision between objects will convert some of the kinetic energy into internal energy and other forms of energy, so no large scale impacts are perfectly elastic. Elastic collisions usually involve sub-atomic particles or highly rigid objects e.g. steel or glass balls. If both objects have same mass, their velocities swap after perfectly elastic collision, e.g. Newtonâ€™s cradle.  "Collisions" in which the objects do not touch each other, such as Rutherford scattering or the slingshot orbit of a satellite off a planet, are elastic collisions. In atomic or nuclear scattering, the collisions are typically elastic because the repulsive Coulomb force keeps the particles out of contact with each other. Collisions in ideal gases are very nearly elastic, and this fact is used in the development of the expressions for gas pressure in a container. Since total momentum and total kinetic energy is conserved in elastic collision, eqn. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn-col1.html" title="Equation 5.4.1">(5.4.1)</a> along with eqn. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn-col2.html" title="Equation 5.4.2">(5.4.2)</a> can help solve the problem,</div>
