<div class="para">Kirchhoff has two fundamental principles in the study of thermal radiation and the behavior of materials with regard to electromagnetic radiation. The details of Kirchhoff’s law is not a part of discussion here but only taken here for some information. Kirchhoff’s first law states that at any temperature, the ratio of the emissive power to the absorptive power for a given wavelength is the same for all bodies and is equal to the emissive power of a perfectly black body.</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">In other words, this law states that the emissivity (<span class="process-math">\(\epsilon\)</span>) of an object at a particular wavelength is equal to its absorptivity (<span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span>) at that same wavelength. That is,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\epsilon (\lambda) = \alpha(\lambda)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">the amount of radiation that an object emits at a specific wavelength is equal to the amount of radiation it absorbs at that same wavelength when the object is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings.</div>
</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Kirchhoff’s second law states that at every temperature and for every wavelength, the emissivity (<span class="process-math">\(\epsilon\)</span>) of a perfect black body is equal to 1. That is,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\epsilon (\lambda) =1
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">a perfect black body is an idealized object that absorbs all incident radiation and emits radiation at the maximum possible rate for a given temperature. It is often used as a reference to compare the behavior of real objects in radiative heat transfer.</div>
