<div class="para">Entropy is intimately connected with the probability. If you toss four pennies, then it has very less chance that all four will land heads up. It is six times more likely to get two heads and two tails up. The two heads - two tails state is the most likely, shows the most disorder, and has the highest entropy. Four heads is less likely, has the most order, and the lowest entropy. If you tossed more coins, it would be even less likely that they’d all land heads up, and even more likely that you’d end up with close to the same number of heads as tails.</div>
