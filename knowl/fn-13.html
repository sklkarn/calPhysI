</h4>Molecular weight and molar weight are related terms that are often used interchangeably, but they have slightly different meanings. Molecular weight refers to the mass of a single molecule of a substance in atomic mass units (amu) or unified atomic mass units (u). Molar weight, also known as <dfn class="terminology">molar mass</dfn>, refers to the mass of one mole of a substance in unit of grams per mole (g/mol). The molar mass of a compound is numerically equal to its molecular weight but has units of grams per mole. For example, the molar mass of water (<span class="process-math">\(H_2O\)</span>) is approximately 18.015 g/mol, which is the same as its molecular weight (18.015 amu).</div>
