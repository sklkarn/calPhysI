<div class="para">We may also have noticed that the temperature of water doesn’t change during boiling. The temperature of water increases up to boiling and then remains constant as it boils. The following diagram illustrates the relationship between temperature and amount of heat needed to change the phases of water. We can see that the temperature increases as heat is added to water within a phase. Adding heat into the water increases the kinetic energy of water molecules within the ice. During the phase change, the added heat doesn’t make the molecules move faster, but make them further apart. The heat energy added during the phase change is consumed to overcome intermolecular force of attraction and stored within the material in the form of potential energy of the molecules. Where amount of heat added to the system can be obtained by <span class="process-math">\(Q_{1}= (mc\Delta T)_{ice},\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(Q_{2}= (mL_{f})_{ice\to water}, \)</span> <span class="process-math">\(Q_{3}= (mc\Delta T)_{water},\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(Q_{4}= (mL_{v})_{water\to vapor},\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q_{5}= (mc\Delta T)_{vapor}.\)</span>
