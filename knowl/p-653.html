<div class="para">A spring of a force constant <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is compressed using a block of mass <span class="process-math">\(m_{1}\)</span> to a distance <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>  The spring is fixed to a  L-shaped block of mass <span class="process-math">\(m_{2}\)</span> which is free to slid on  frictionless ground surface as shown in figure below. There is friction between the two blocks, howewver and when the block 1 is released and spring reaches to its equilibrium position, then block 1 is moving leftward with velocity <span class="process-math">\(v_{1}\)</span>  and block 2 is moving rightward  with velocity <span class="process-math">\(v_{2}.\)</span>
