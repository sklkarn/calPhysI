<div class="para">While cooling process heat is taken out from the system, then latent heat of vaporization becomes latent heat of condensation and latent heat of melting becomes latent heat of fusion. For water, latent heat of melting and latent heat of fusion are same. Similarly, latent heat of vaporization and latent heat of condensation are same but they are not same for many other materials.  Phase of matter changes from solid to liquid is called melting or <em class="emphasis">fusion</em>,  from solid to gas is called <em class="emphasis">sublimation</em>, from liquid to solid is called <em class="emphasis">freezing</em>, from liquid to gas is called <em class="emphasis">evaporation</em> or boiling, from gas to solid is called <em class="emphasis">deposition</em>, from gas to liquid is called <em class="emphasis">condensation</em>, from plasma state to gaseous state is called <em class="emphasis">recombination</em>, and from gaseous state to plasma state is called <em class="emphasis">ionization</em>.</div>
