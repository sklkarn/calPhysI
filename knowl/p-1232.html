<div class="para">Reversible heat engine is just the heat engine which is running in the reverse direction of heat engine. In reversible heat engine all the three components re-assume exactly their original conditions and no changes are left in the surroundings. Such an engine can be realized if, the engine is free from friction, the process is infinitely slow, and working substance never differs appreciable from its surroundings. No heat engine can have efficiency greater than a reversible heat engine.</div>
