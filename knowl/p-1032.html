If these events have been observed very closely we can find that water surface behaves as if it is  a thin stretched membrane of some kind. The strength of such membrane arises due to intermolecular attraction of the liquid. Liquid molecules try to get as closer as they can. The minimum average distance between the molecules of a liquid occurs when the liquid acquires a spherical shape. A spherical surface possess minimum surface area. Hence a property of a liquid by virtue of which it acquires minimum surface area is called a <dfn class="terminology">surface tension</dfn>. The cohesive nature of a liquid helps resist an external force.  If a force <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is acting on a length <span class="process-math">\(l\)</span> by the liquid surface to balance an external force then, it can be seen that</div>
