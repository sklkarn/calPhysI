<div class="para">Surface tension arises due to strong intermolecular forces of attraction between the molecules. When those forces act between like molecules, they are referred to as <dfn class="terminology">cohesive forces</dfn>. Cohesion is a tendency of the liquid to remain as one assembly of particles. Surface tension is due to cohesion between particles at the free surface.  A liquid, however, is often in contact with a solid surface, such as glass. Hence the additional forces of attraction occur between molecules of the liquid and molecules of the solid surface. When the attractive forces act between unlike molecules, they are said to be <dfn class="terminology">adhesive forces</dfn>. This property enables a liquid to stick to another body.</div>
