<dfn class="terminology">Free expansion:</dfn> It is an adiabatic process in which no work is performed on or by the system. Consider two chambers of an isolated system, the one chamber of which contains a gas while the other is completely evacuated. Both the chambers are connected with a stopcock. When stopcock is suddenly open, the gas rushes into the evacuated chamber and expands freely. Free expansion means gas has to do no work at all. Since an isolated system does not exchange heat from outside world,</div>
