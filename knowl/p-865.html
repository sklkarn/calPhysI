<div class="para">Equation for simple harmonic oscillation can be obtained by considering a spring-mass system, but the equation can be used for any other system performing SHM. Consider a block of mass <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> attached to the spring and one end of spring is fixed to the wall. If the block is displaced by the distance <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> from the mean position of spring-block system and released on a frictionless surface then restoring force of spring is proportional to the displacement. That is,</div>

<div class="para">Where <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is proportionality constant, called a force constant. It defines the elastic property of material, hence it is also called elastic constant. For spring we may also called <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> as stiffness constant. However, if the restoring force has some other source then elastic property of material then <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is simply a proportionality constant and depends on the nature of space, e.g. gravitational field in case of simple pendulum. <span class="process-math">\(-ve\)</span> sign here shows restoring force is always opposite to the displacement from the mean position. <a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-7-hidden.html" title="Footnote 7.5.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>

<div class="para">Where <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}=\omega,\)</span> is the angular frequency (velocity) of the object executing SHM or performing circular motion. Angular frequency, <span class="process-math">\(\omega\)</span> is taken as <span class="process-math">\(+ve\)</span> because phaser always revolves anticlockwise. In the <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/shm1.html" title="Figure 7.5.3">Figure 7.5.3</a>, <span class="process-math">\(l\)</span> is a mean length of spring-mass system and <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is displacement from the equilibrium position at any time <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> Here point <span class="process-math">\(O\)</span> is equilibrium position and points <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> are two extremes. Now as acceleration, <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is a function of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is also a function of <span class="process-math">\(t,\)</span> we can also have velocity, <span class="process-math">\(v=f(x,t)\text{.}\)</span> Therefore,</div>
