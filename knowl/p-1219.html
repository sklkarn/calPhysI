<div class="para">The first law of thermodynamics gives an equivalence between the quantity of heat and the mechanical work or vice-versa. This law does not tell the limitation and condition of conversion. That is how much heat is converted into work and whether the transformaiton itself can take place or not. The first law does not tell anything about the direction of transformation of energy.  It  does not indicate whether heat can flow from a cold end to a hot end or not. The first law places no restriction on the direction of a process, and satisfying the first law does not guarantee that the process will occur.  In practice, it is not possible to convert the heat energy into an equivalent amount of work. Thus, we need another general principle  to identify whether a process can occur or not. The law specifying the condition of transformation of heat into work is called the second law of thermodynamics. The second law of thermodynamics tells the direction of the flow of heat. It also tells that heat energy cannot be completely converted into equivalent work.</div>
