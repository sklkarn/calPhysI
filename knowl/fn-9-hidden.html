<body class="ignore-math"><div class="fn">Even though force and area are vector quantities, pressure is not a vector, one reason is that the division of vectors with another vectors is undefined in mathematics, the other reason is that when a pressure is being applied in the liquid, it transmitted equally on every section of its enclosed surface and does not matter what the orientations of these surfaces are. In upper level physics we do study about stress tensor where we define pressure as a tensor rather than a scalar but for now we take pressure as a scalar quantity.</div></body>
