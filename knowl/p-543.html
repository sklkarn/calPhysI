<div class="para">From the principle of conservation of energy as kinetic energy of the system increases its potential energy decreases. This means the force acting on a particle is the rate at which the potential energy decreases in any given direction as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/SHMenergy.html" title="Figure 5.1.4.(a)">Figure 5.1.4.(a)</a>. At point a, the slope of <span class="process-math">\(U(x)\)</span> is positive, i.e., the x-component of the  force is in the negative x direction. At the point b, the slope is negative and hence the force is  positive. The force increases as the slope of <span class="process-math">\(U(x)\)</span> increases. The point in the middle, at <span class="process-math">\(x = 0\text{,}\)</span> is is a minimum of <span class="process-math">\(U(x)\)</span> and hence the slope is zero. Therefore the x-directed force F at that point is zero as well. A point at which the force on an object is zero is a point of <dfn class="terminology">static equilibrium</dfn> [<a href="subsec-statics.html#subsubsec-state_eqlbrm" class="internal" title="Subsubsection 4.1.4.1: Static Equilibrium">Subsubsection 4.1.4.1</a>], i.e., a particle is at rest and will remain there at rest. If the particle is displaced by a small distance to the right or the left of the equilibrium point, the force pushes the particle back towards equilibrium. Points where the force is zero and small displacements cause a restoring force to bring the particle  back to the same points are called <dfn class="terminology">stable equilibrium</dfn> points [<a href="subsec-st_equlbrm.html" class="internal" title="Subsection 4.11.2: States of Equilibrium">Subsection 4.11.2</a>].</div>
