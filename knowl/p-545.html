<div class="para">The forces between neutral atoms are extremely small, nearly zero, if atoms are very far away from one another. This is illustrated as an extended region where the potential energy is flat for large r as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/potEcurve.html" title="Figure 5.1.4.(b)">Figure 5.1.4.(b)</a>. Such region is called <dfn class="terminology">neutral equilibrium</dfn> [<a href="subsec-st_equlbrm.html" class="internal" title="Subsection 4.11.2: States of Equilibrium">Subsection 4.11.2</a>] because there are no forces that either restore or repel the two atoms. When two atoms reaches closer, their interaction becomes first weakly attractive due to quantum dipole-induced dipole interactions and then weakly repulsive as the two atoms start to touch each other. There is a potential energy minimum in between where two atoms separated by a certain distance can be in stable equilibrium without being chemically bound. If atoms approaches more closely then they encounter a second potential energy well that is at first strongly attractive to an actual chemical interaction between them followed by a hard core repulsion as the electron clouds are prevented from interpenetrating by the Pauli exclusion principle. This second potential energy well is often modeled by a Lenard-Jones potential energy corresponding to the inverse powers of <span class="process-math">\(r\text{.}\)</span> It also has a point of stable equilibrium. In between, there is a point where the growing attraction of the inner potential energy well and the growing repulsion of the outer potential energy well balance, so that the potential energy function has a maximum. At this maximum the slope is zero, a position of force equilibrium but because the force on either side of this point pushes the particle away from it, this is a point of <dfn class="terminology">unstable equilibrium</dfn> [<a href="subsec-st_equlbrm.html" class="internal" title="Subsection 4.11.2: States of Equilibrium">Subsection 4.11.2</a>]. Unstable equilibria occur at isolated maxima in the potential energy function, just as stable equilibria occur at isolated minima. <a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-6-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.1.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a>
