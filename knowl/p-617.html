Suppose that both objects are subject to zero net force unless they are in contact with one another. During the collision, the first object exerts a large transitory force <span class="process-math">\(f_{21}\)</span> on the second, whereas the second object exerts an equal and opposite force <span class="process-math">\(f_{12}=-f_{21}\)</span> on the first. That is, they transfer equal and opposite impulses on one another at the instant of collision. If <span class="process-math">\(v_{1}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v_{2}\)</span> are the velocity of the objects after collision, and there is no external force acting on the objects then from the principle of conservation of momentum, we have</div>
