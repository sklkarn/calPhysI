<div class="para">Friction is a resistive force that opposes or tends to oppose relative motion between two objects. It is a force that exists between the surfaces of contact of the two objects [<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/friction.html" title="Figure 4.1.4.(a)">Figure 4.1.4.(a)</a>]. If two systems are in contact and stationary relative to each other, then the friction between them is called <dfn class="terminology">static friction</dfn>. This force arises from mechanical interlocking at the microscopic level plus the electrostatic molecular forces that hold the surfaces themselves together. If two systems are in contact and moving relative to one another, then the friction between them is called <dfn class="terminology">kinetic friction</dfn>. This force arises from forming and breaking of microscopic adhesive bonds between atoms on the surfaces plus some mechanical linkage between the small irregularities on the surfaces as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/friction1.html" title="Figure 4.1.4.(b)">Figure 4.1.4.(b)</a>. Experimentally it is found that frictional force is proportional to normal force, i.e., <span class="process-math">\(f \propto N \)</span>  as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/friction2.html" title="Figure 4.1.4.(c)">Figure 4.1.4.(c)</a>.</div>
