<div class="para">The center of mass of a system of particles is a point in space at which the net mass of the system seems to be located. It is the mean position of the mass of a system or a body. <dfn class="terminology">Center of gravity</dfn> is an imaginary point in a body where the entire weight of the body may be assumed to be concentrated or it is a point at which the gravity appears to act. In a uniform gravitational field the center of gravity is identical to the center of mass, but they do not coincide in a non-uniform gravitational field. Imagine that you are lying horizontally in space above the planet where you are experiencing a greater gravitational field strength towards your head than towards your feet, then your center of gravity is located somewhere near your shoulder rather than your belly button (i.e. navel or your center of mass). The <dfn class="terminology">center of gravity</dfn> (or center of mass) may coincide with a geometric center of the body if it has a uniform mass distribution and possess symmetrical shape. An asymmetrical object composed of a variety of materials with different masses, however, has a center of gravity located at some distance from its geometric center. In some cases, such as hollow bodies or irregularly shaped objects, the center of gravity (or center of mass) may occur in space at a point external to the physical material. For example, the center of mass of binary stars lies between the stars and in the center of a tennis ball.</div>
