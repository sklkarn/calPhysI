<div class="para">The rotational effect of force is called a torque. It is a physical quantity that changes the objectâ€™s state of rotational motion. It is a rotational analog of force in a linear motion.  It depends on the magnitude, direction and location of force that is acting on the body. Imagine we try to push a door to open it. How much push we apply to rotate the door depends on how far from the hinges (the pivot point <span class="process-math">\(O\)</span>) and the direction we are applying a force. The closer we are to the hinges (the smaller r), the harder it is to push. The torque we created on the door is smaller when we push it near the hinge than it would be away from its hinges.</div>
