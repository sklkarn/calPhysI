<span class="heading"><span class="title">Conduction.</span></span><div class="para">In this process heat is transferred through stationary matter by physical contact. In microscopic level atoms and molecules are always in random motion at any temperature above absolute zero. When heated these particles (atoms and molecules) gain thermal energy and begin vibrating even higher amplitude knocking the neighboring particles. By doing so they impart some of their energy to their neighboring particles, and so on. Eventually heat is carried away from  one end of a substance to another. In conduction, heat carrying  particles do not physically move from its place rather they  transfer their energy to neighbors when they knock one another. Every time they knock pass some of their energy to next one and returns to their original place. Heat transfers from the burner of a stove through the bottom of a pan to food in the pan is transferred by conduction. Conduction occurs in all states of substances solid, liquid, and gas. In solids, conduction happens due to molecular vibration. In gases and liquids, it is due to collisions and diffusion of the molecules during their random motion.</div>

<span class="heading"><span class="title">Radiation.</span></span><div class="para logical">
<div class="para">It is the process in which heat transfer without the need of intervening medium. Heat transfer occurs in this process when electromagnetic waves emitted or absorbed. The warming of the earth surface by the Sun is due to radiation. Heat transfer by this process is the fastest one. All bodies above absolute zero emit thermal radiation. At room temperature the radiation is in the infrared range, wavelengths longer than those of the visible spectrum. In atomic domain, the radiation is caused because of oscillating ions and electrons in a warm solid are accelerating electric charges, such charges radiate. Different substances radiate with different efficiencies. The good radiator of radiation is a good absorber of radiation. A perfect absorber is called a <dfn class="terminology">black body</dfn> (such perfection is not found in nature, but some things are close). Hence a black body is also a perfect radiator. A black body  absorbs and emits radiation of all most all frequencies. It was found experimentally that heat energy radiated per unit time per unit surface area of a perfectly black body is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature. This statement is also called <dfn class="terminology">Stefan-Boltzmann law</dfn>. That is,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{E}{tA}\propto T^{4}

\begin{equation}
\therefore \quad P  =  \sigma A \epsilon T^{4}\tag{10.3.7}

<div class="para">where <span class="process-math">\(\sigma =  5.67\times10^{-8} \,W/m^{2}.K^{4}\)</span> is called Stefan-Boltzmann constant and <span class="process-math">\(\epsilon\)</span> is called <em class="emphasis">emissivity</em> of the object.

<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
P=\sigma A \epsilon \left(T^{4}-T_{o}^{4}\right)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">For any particular wavelength and temperature the amount of thermal radiation emitted depends on the emissivity of the object’s surface. <dfn class="terminology">Emissivity</dfn> is defined as the ratio of the energy radiated from a material’s surface to that radiated from a blackbody at the same temperature and wavelength under the same viewing conditions. It is a dimensionless number between 0 (for a perfect reflector) and 1 (for a perfect emitter). The emissivity of a surface depends not only on the material but also on the <em class="emphasis">nature of the surface</em>. For example, a clean and polished metal surface will have a low emissivity, whereas a roughened and oxidized metal surface will have a high emissivity. The emissivity also depends on the temperature of the surface as well as wavelength and angle.</div>
