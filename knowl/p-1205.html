<div class="para">The word <dfn class="terminology">thermodynamics</dfn> was coined by Lord Kelvin in 1849. It is a combination of two words, <em class="emphasis">thermo</em> that refers heat and <em class="emphasis">dynamics</em> that refers force or motion of the molecules or atoms. It is the branch of physics which deals with heat energy, its transfer, and energy conversion. It begins its journey with the development of fire. People used to believe that every substance has some amount of invisible fluid called caloric fluid. When it moves from one object to another the object becomes hot or cold. The object which loses caloric fluid becomes cold and which gains caloric fluid becomes hot. We know now that there is nothing like caloric fluid but it is a heat energy which exists in a material due to molecular vibration. Heat is a form of energy that can flow due to temperature difference. We can obtain an infinite amount of heat energy out of the material. For example, we can produced an infinite amount of heat from water by performing a continuous mechanical work (as in <em class="emphasis">Joul’s experiment</em> <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/jouleexpt.html" title="Figure 10.6.3.(a)">Figure 10.6.3.(a)</a>) without changing the condition of water. Work is also an energy that is transferred from one system to another without considering the temperature difference between them.</div>
