<div class="para">Dimensional analysis is a method in which the relationship between different physical quantities (or units) can be analyzed by identifying their base quantities (or units). Dimensional analysis helps convert the  units of one system into another system or helps check the resulting formula in a physical process. Some quantities have no dimensions and they are called dimensionless quantities, e.g. the ratio of two lengths are dimensionless. The dimensional consistency does  not guarantee the correctness of equations. It is uncertain to the extent of dimensionless  quantities or functions. Dimensional analysis is based on the principle of homogeneity which states that the dimensions of both sides of an equation are same.  For example, in the equation below dimension on left is equal to dimension on right.</div>
