<div class="para">The shortest distance between line of action of force to the point of rotation of a body is called the <dfn class="terminology">lever arm</dfn> or moment arm. Torque is maximum when force and lever arm are perpendicularly to each other. There will be no torque if a force is applied at the pivot point (point of rotation) since the moment arm would be zero (r = 0). It is a vector quantity and its direction is always perpendicular to the plane describes by a lever arm and a force. Our right hand can be useful to find the direction of torque. Stretch your right hand fingures in the direction of lever arm then curl them in a direction of force. Now thumb must be oriented in the direction of torque. Since torque is associated with three dimensional case but the motion of object we consider here is only in a plane we make it simple by using the following convention.</div>
