<div class="para">From Newton’s II law of motion, when an external unbalanced force acts on an object, it will give  an acceleration <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> to that object, that is, <span class="process-math">\(F = ma\text{.}\)</span> But, if the gravitational force is acting on the body near the surface of the earth, then the body experiences the acceleration <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> for a freely falling body. This force is called weight of the body, <span class="process-math">\(w = mg\text{.}\)</span> Hence,</div>

The shape of earth is not a perfect sphere, rather, it is an oblate spheroid. That is, the radius of the earth at the equator <span class="process-math">\(R_{eq}\)</span> is slightly greater than the radius of the earth at the poles <span class="process-math">\(R_{pol}\)</span> as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/NLG1.html" title="Figure 6.1.1">Figure 6.1.1</a>.
