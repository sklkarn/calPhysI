<div class="para">Newton’s first law provides the definition of force which states that every object in a state of rest remains at rest or in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in that motion along the same direction, unless an external force is applied onto it. Force is not required to continue the motion of anything which is already in motion.</div>
<div class="para">The first law is also called a law of inertia.  <dfn class="terminology">Inertia</dfn> is an ability of an object to resist changes in its motion. In other words, we can say the laziness of an object to change its mechanical state is called an inertia. Mass is related to inertia, the bigger the mass the more difficult it is to change its state of rest or motion.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="subsec-Nlaw_motion.html#li-297" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
