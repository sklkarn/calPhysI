<div class="para">A body which does not deform (i.e., the distance between two points never changes) under the influence of forces is known as a rigid body. However, there is no such thing as a perfect rigid body in real life. Practically all bodies deform somewhat more or less with the applied force.  A rigid body conserves its shape under the action of external forces. A concrete pillar, a dead snake, bones, etc can be considered as  rigid bodies. In rigid body a physics of real object is described for its real dimension not as we have described physics earlier for an object by considering it as a point mass.</div>
