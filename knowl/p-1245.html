<div class="para">Now combine these two engines in such a way that engine I drives the engine R in the backward direction, so that R behaves as a refrigerator. The refrigerator R then extracts <span class="process-math">\(Q_{r}-W\)</span> heat from the sink, after  <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> work done on it by I it rejects <span class="process-math">\(Q_{r} \)</span> heat to the source. The two engines are so coupled that they behave as a self acting machine. Since the work needed to run the refrigerator R is supplied by the irreversible engine I.
