<div class="para">Kelvin scale of temperature is the standard metric system of temperature measurement and mostly used by scientists. The Kelvin scale has 100 equal degree increments between the freezing point and the boiling point of water just as the Celsius scale. However, the zero-degree mark on the Kelvin scale is 273.15 units cooler than it is on the Celsius scale. So a temperature of 0 Kelvin is equivalent to a temperature of <span class="process-math">\(-273.15^{o}C.\)</span> Traditionally, degree symbol is not used with the Kelvin scale. So a temperature of 300 units above 0 Kelvin is referred to as 300 Kelvin and not 300 degree Kelvin. Hence  300 Kelvin is abbreviated as 300 K. Conversions among Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales are summarized below.</div>
