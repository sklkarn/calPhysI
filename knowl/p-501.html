<div class="para">A 60 kg man and his 40 kg dog are sitting together at the left end of a 8.0 m long boat. The boat is 100 kg, and its center of mass lies at the geometric center. The boat starts out at rest in the middle of a calm lake. Ignore all friction and water resistance throughout this problem.</div>

<li><div class="para">Suppose that the dog moves to the other end of the boat, while the man stays still. How far does the boat move and in which direction? (left or right).</div></li>
<li><div class="para">After reaching the other end of the boat, the dog jumps off with a horizontal velocity of 2.0 m/s, directed to the right, as measured relative to the water. What is the speed with which the boat and the man drift in the opposite direction?</div></li>
