<div class="para">From <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig3f.html" title="Figure 3.1.8.(a)">Figure 3.1.8.(a)</a>, slope of line AB=+ve, slope of line BC=0, and slope of line CD =-ve, which means the object is running with constant velocity along +ve direction, stays at rest, and again starts moving with constant velocity along -ve direction, respectively. The slope of bottom portion of curve DE =0 nd that at top portion is +ve hence the object is speeding up in +ve direction.  The slope of bottom portion of curve EF =+ve and that at top portion =0, hence the object is slowing down in +ve direction. The slope of top portion of curve FG =0 and that at bottom portion is -ve, hence the object is speeding up in -ve direction. The slope of top portion of curve GH =-ve and that at bottom portion =0, hence the object is slowing down in -ve direction as can be verified in figure <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig3g.html" title="Figure 3.1.8.(b)">Figure 3.1.8.(b)</a>. If velocity is constant there is no acceleration and if velocity is increasing in +ve direction, acceleration is +ve, if velocity is decreasing in +ve direction, acceleration is -ve, if velocity is increasing in -ve direction, acceleration is -ve, if velocity is decreasing in -ve direction, acceleration is +ve as can be seen from graph <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig3h.html" title="Figure 3.1.8.(c)">Figure 3.1.8.(c)</a>.</div>
