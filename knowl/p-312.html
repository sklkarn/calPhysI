<div class="para">There are four fundamental forces in nature: gravitational, electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear. <dfn class="terminology">Gravitational force</dfn> is the weakest known forces in nature. It is a long range force. It exists due to mass of the objects. <dfn class="terminology">Electromagnetic force</dfn> is also a long range force and is stronger than gravitational force. It exists due to charges of the objects. <dfn class="terminology">Strong nuclear force</dfn> is the strongest known force but it is the shortest range force which only exists inside the nucleus. Its main job is to hold subatomic particles of the nucleus together. (i.e. binding the positively charged protons and neutral neutrons inside the nucleus). <dfn class="terminology">Weak nuclear force</dfn> is weaker than strong nuclear force and electromagnetic force. It is also a very short range force and accounts for the radioactivity in unstable nuclei.</div>
