<div class="para">Where proportionality constant <span class="process-math">\(\mu\)</span> is called coefficient of friction. It defines the nature of roughness of the surfaces being in contact. It is a dimensional less quantity. The coefficient of friction is a property of materials and does not change with the angle.  For static friction, <span class="process-math">\(f_{s} \leq \mu_{s}\)</span> N. The symbol <span class="process-math">\(\leq\)</span> implies that static friction can have a maximum value of <span class="process-math">\(\mu_{s} N\text{.}\)</span> Static friction is a responsive force that increases to be equal and opposite to whatever force is being exerted, up to its maximum limit. Once the applied force exceeds <span class="process-math">\(f_{s} (max) \text{,}\)</span> the object moves. Thus, <span class="process-math">\(f_{s}(max) = \mu_{s} N\text{.}\)</span> For kinetic friction, <span class="process-math">\(f_{k} =\mu_{k} N\text{.}\)</span> Remember the direction of friction is always opposite to the direction of motion or applied force, not in the direction of normal. Hence the above equations has no vector form.</div>
