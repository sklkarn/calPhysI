<div class="para">Energy and collisions are fundamental concepts in physics. It helps us to understand the behavior of objects and particles in the universe. Energy is an ability of a system to do work. It is a scalar quantity. It comes in various forms, such as mechanical energy {kinetic energy (associated with the motion of an object), potential energy (related to an objectâ€™s position or state)}, and many others. The conservation of energy principle states that the total energy in a closed system remains constant, even though energy can transform from one form to another. This principle is essential in analyzing various physical phenomena, from simple mechanical systems to complex processes in the natural world.</div>
