    <p>
      An asteroid 1 mi in diameter of density <m>4 g/cm^{3}</m> enters the earth's gravity 
      when it is at rest with respect to the solar system. 
      <ol marker ="a.">
        <li>
          What is the speed of the asteroid with respect to the earth before entering the earth's gravity? 
              </li>
        <li>
          What is the speed of the asteroid when it hits the surface of the earth?  
             </li>
             <li>
              What is the energy of the asteroid when it hits the earth's surface? 
             </li>
             <li>
              How does this compare with the amount of solar energy which hits the 
      surface of the earth every day if the solar constant is <m>1.37 kW/m^{2}</m>? 
             </li>
               </ol>
