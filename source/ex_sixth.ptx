    <p>
      An asteroid 1 mi in diameter of density <m>4 \,g/cm^{3}</m> enters the earth's gravity 
      when it is at rest with respect to the solar system. 
      <ol marker ="a.">
        <li>
          What is the speed of the asteroid with respect to the earth before entering the earth's gravity? 
              </li>
        <li>
          What is the speed of the asteroid when it hits the surface of the earth?  
             </li>
             <li>
              What is the energy of the asteroid when it hits the earth's surface? 
             </li>
             <li>
              How does this compare with the amount of solar energy which hits the 
      surface of the earth every day if the solar constant is <m>1.37 \,kW/m^{2}</m>? 
             </li>
               </ol>

    A rock of mass 500 kg is dropped from a height of 1 m. While it is falling, 
    <ol marker ="a.">
      <li>
        how hard does the earth pull down on the rock? 
            </li>
      <li>
        how hard does the rock pull up on the earth? 
           </li>
           <li>
            why doesn't the earth move upward to meet the rock?
           </li>
            </ol>

<exercise>
  <p>
    If the the earth were a sphere of radius <m>6.37\times 10^{6} \,m</m>, the acceleration 
    due to gravity at the surface of the earth were <m>9.8 \,m/s^{2}</m>, and the universal 
    gravitational constant were <m>6.67\times 10^{-11} \,N.m^{2}/kg^{2}</m>, what would be the mass of the earth?

    The Moon is 384,400 km distant from the Earth's center, and it completes 
    an orbit in 27.3 days.

      <li>
        Determine the Moon's orbital speed. 
            </li>

      <li>
        Io, a small moon of Jupiter, has an orbital period of 1.77 days 
        and an orbital radius of <m>4.22\times 10^{5} \,km</m>.  From these data, determine the mass of Jupiter.
            </li>
      <li>
        Ganymede, Jupiter's largest moon, has an orbital period of 7.16 days. What is its orbital radius?

  <p>
    Find the difference in potential energy of a satellite of mass <m>m_{s}=2.50\times10^{3}\,kg</m>, 
    when it is at a distance of <m>2.55 \times10^{9} \,m</m> and when it is at 
    the distance of <m>4.30\times10^{7} \,m</m> from the center of the earth.

<exercise>
  <p>
    Three point masses of 30.0 kg, 50.0 kg, and 70.0 kg are located at the vertices 
    of an equilateral triangle 1.00 m on a side. Find the resultant gravitational force on each mass.

<exercise>
  <p>
    At what speed would the earth have to rotate such that the centripetal 
    force at the equator would be equal to the weight of a body there? 
    If the earth rotated at this velocity, how long would a day be? 
    If a 900-N man stood on a weighing scale there, what would the scales read?
