      A physical world can be described by using varieties of physical quantities, 
      they are a <term>scalar physical quantity</term> (or, simply  <em>scalars</em>) 
      <idx><h>scalars</h></idx>and a <term>vector physical quantity</term> (or, simply 
      <em>vectors</em>)<idx><h>vectors</h></idx>. A <alert>scalar</alert> quantity has only 
      magnitude (size), 
      e.g., mass, length, time, volume, density, work, speed, temperature, potential, 
      current, resistance, flux, power, intensity, etc. and a <alert>vector</alert> quantity 
      has both magnitude and direction, e.g., velocity, acceleration, displacement, momentum, 
      force, weight, torque, impulse, moment, current density, etc. A quantity like surface 
      area is a scalar in general, but when considered with its specific orientation, it 
      is taken as a vector quantity. In physics, when area comes with any vector quantity 
      in a mathematical operation it is considered as a vector. For instance, flux is a 
      dot product of two vectors, one of them is an area. Area has a direction which is always 
      taken as an outward normal to the surface. Mathematically, division of a vector with 
      another vector is undefined, hence pressure is considered as a scalar even if it is 
      defined as a force per unit area. <fn>
        <p>
          <em>Displacement:</em> It is the shortest distance between any two points 
          (e.g., distance between initial point and final point). Hence it has a particular 
          direction. <em>Velocity:</em> If a direction is included with the speed then 
          it is called a velocity. <em>Weight:</em> It is a force exerted by a planet on any 
          object and hence is always pointed towards the center of the planet.

      A vector is represented by an arrow. The arrow shows the direction of a vector and 
      the length of the arrow represents the magnitude of that vector.  It is denoted by 
      a letter with an arrow over it such as <m>\vec{OP} = \vec{a}</m> and its magnitude is 
      denoted by <m>\vec{|a|}</m> or simply by <m>a</m> as shown in <xref ref="fig2a"/>.
      A vector of unit magnitude is called a unit vector and is denoted by <m>\hat{a}</m>, 
      a 'cap', where <m>\hat{a}=\frac{\vec{a}}{\vec{|a|}}</m>. A vector which specifies the position of 
      point P with respect to its origin O is called a position vector, where points O 
      and P are known as the initial point (tail) and the terminal point (head) of the 
      vector <alert>OP</alert>, respectively. The vectors with same magnitude but in 
      opposite direction are termed as negative vectors. Vectors having the same direction are 
      called like vectors, whereas those having opposite directions are called  unlike vectors. 
      The vectors parallel to the same line regardless of their magnitudes and directions are  
      called collinear vectors. The vectors whose directions are not parallel to each other are 
      non-collinear vectors. A system of vectors lying in the parallel planes or in the same 
      plane are called  coplanar vectors. The system of vectors which can not lie in the same 
      plane or parallel planes are called  non-coplanar vectors. <idx><h>vectors</h></idx>
