  <title>Energy and Collision</title>
    
  <introduction>
    <p>
      If an object is displaced along the same direction as the force is applied  
      then the work is said to be done. If a force <m>F</m> displaces a body to a 
      distance <m>d</m> along the direction of force then work can be calculated by 
      <m>W= Fd</m>. Work is a scalar quantity as it is a measure of transfer of energy 
      from one object to another. The physical quantities which can be obtained by dot 
      product of two vectors are scalar. 
      <me>
        \vec{A} \cdot \vec{B}	=  A B \cos\theta =  A_{x} B_{x} + A_{y} B_{y} +  A_{z} B_{z} \quad \textbf{Dot Product}
      </me>
      The unit of work is joule in SI system, <m>Joule (J) =  N.m</m>; 
      in FPS system, ft-lb  =  foot.pound; and in CGS system, erg  =  dyne.cm.

        Suppose a block of mass <m>m</m> is displaced to a distance <m>d</m> along the 
        horizontal direction by the application of force <m>\vec{F}</m> [<xref ref="ec1"/>]. If the force 
        <m>\vec{F}</m> is acting along a direction <m>\theta</m> to the horizontal, 
        then work done by the force is given by 
        <men xml:id="eqn-work1">
          W=\vec{F}\cdot\vec{d}=Fd\cos\theta = (F\cos\theta)d = F_{x}d
        </men>
        The work done by a force is defined as the product of component 
        of the force  in the direction of displacement and the magnitude of displacement.  
        Work in physics is different than our daily life work. Suppose you are pushing a 
        rigid brick wall very hard, after some time you get exhausted because you lose 
        your body energy. In our daily life we called this action as a work, but in physics 
        this is not a work because the object did not displace from its position. Hence 
        in physics, whether the force or the displacement is zero, there is no work. 
        Depending upon the angle between the applied force and the displacement, 
        work could be negative, positive, or zero. For example, work done by a frictional 
        force, or work done by a force acting opposite to the motion of object, 
        <me>
          W_{f}=\vec{f}\cdot\vec{d} = -fd,
        </me>
       work done by a force acting parallel to the motion of object, 
       <me>
        W_{F}=\vec{F}\cdot\vec{d} = Fd\cos0^{o}=Fd,
       </me>
       and work done by a force acting perpendicular to the motion of object, 
       <me>
        W_{F}=\vec{F}\cdot\vec{d} = Fd\cos90^{o}=0.
       </me>
        </p>
    
<p>
  If a force 
  <me>
    \vec{F}=F_{x} \hat{i}+ F_{y} \hat{j}+F_{z} \hat{k} 
  </me>
  displaces an object to a small distance <m>\,d\vec{r},</m> where 
  <me>
    \vec{r}=x\hat{i}+y\hat{j}+z\hat{k}
  </me>
    then work done by this force is given by <fn>If <me>
      \vec{r}=x\hat{i}+y\hat{j}+z\hat{k},
    </me>
   then <me>
    \,dr = \,dx\hat{i}+\,dy\hat{j}+\,dz\hat{k}
   </me>
   </fn> 
    <me>
      W=\int \vec{F}\cdot\,d\vec{r} = \int F\cos\theta\,dr = \int F_{x}\,dx+\int F_{y}\,dy+\int F_{z}\,dz 
    </me>
    The terms like <m>F_{x}\,dx</m> are area under the curve [<xref ref="ec4"/>]. The sum of these area between 
    initial position to final position along each direction is equal to work done by a 
    variable force F(r), such as force of spring.
