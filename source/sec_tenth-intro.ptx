 <title>Heat</title>
 
 <introduction>
  <p>
    Standing out in a scorching summer day we feel hot and touching an iron bar in the morning 
    of a severing winter day, we feel cold. The sensation of hotness and coldness can be 
    experienced by the increase or decrease of a certain kind of energy which we call <term>heat</term>. 
    <em>Heat</em> is a form of energy that can transfer from one location to another because of the 
    temperature difference between them. A quantitative measure of the sensation of hotness or 
    coldness is given by temperature. Therefore, temperature is the degree of hotness or coldness 
    of a body. Heat energy is produced at the expense of mechanical energy and vice versa. 
    For example, rubbing palms vigorously makes palm warmer. An infinite amount of heat can be 
    extracted from a substance by continually doing mechanical work on it just as heat is 
    obtained from water in Joule's experiment. Work and heat both transfer the energy 
    from one system to another but temperature plays no role in transfer of energy 
    due to work.  Objects can store heat (or thermal energy) because the atoms and molecules 
    of the objects are jostling around and bumping into one another. This type of thermal energy 
    is called internal kinetic energy of the materials. The energy also arise in molecules due 
    to intermolecular attractions. This type of energy is called internal potential energy. 
    During phase change of a material heat is stored in the form of internal potential energy. 
    For example, heating of ice melts it without any rise of temperature. This energy is used 
    in driving the molecules of ice away from each other against their molecular attraction. 
     While internal energy refers to the total energy of all the molecules within the object, 
     heat is the amount of energy flowing from one body to another spontaneously due to their 
     temperature difference. Heat is energy in transit but not a property of the system.

      To measure how hot or cold something is, we use an instrument called a thermometer. 
      Hence, the thermometer is a device used to measure temperature. The definition of 
      temperature is not very straight forward to explain but the degree of hotness or coldness 
      of a body would suffice the definition for now. We will discuss more in defining the 
      temperature in thermodynamics chapter.

 <title>Temperature and Thermometers</title>
  
   <introduction>
   <p>
    There are varieties of thermometers in existence. Based on the phases of materials 
    used in thermometer they are solid state thermometer, liquid thermometer, and gas thermometer. 
    Many physical properties of materials change significantly with temperature can be used as the 
    basis for constructing thermometers. Solid  thermometer works upon the principle that resistances 
    of solid objects are proportional to changes in its temperature. Liquid thermometer works upon the 
    principle that expansion in liquid volume are proportional to changes in its temperature. 
    Gas thermometer works upon the principle that changes in gas pressure are proportional 
    to changes in gas temperature. Here  mainly discussed about liquid thermometer. 
    Liquid thermometers, such as mercury-in-glass or alcohol thermometers, 
    have been widely used for temperature measurement for many years. 
        However, due to toxic effect of mercury for living being mercury thermometers are not much 
    in use these days. The  different calibration process of thermometers produces different 
    types of temperature scales. They are Centigrade (Celsius) scale [<xref ref="therm1"/>], 
    Fahrenheit scale[<xref ref="therm2"/>], and Kelvin scale [<xref ref="therm3"/>]. 
    There are some other types of scales like Rankine's or Reamer's thermometers available but they are almost obsolete. 
    A centigrade thermometer has 100 divisions between the freezing point (0 degree Celsius) and the  
    boiling point (100 degree Celsius) of water. Swedish astronomer Andres Celsius is credited 
    for its development.  A temperature of 76 degree Celsius is abbreviated as <m>76^{o}C.</m> 
    The Celsius scale is the most widely accepted temperature scale in the world except the 
    United States. In Fahrenheit thermometer, there are 180 divisions between the freezing point 
    (32 degree Fahrenheit) and the boiling point (212 degree Fahrenheit) of water. 
    German physicist Daniel Fahrenheit is credited for its development. It is the first modern 
    thermometer developed in 1714. A temperature of 76 degree Fahrenheit is abbreviated as <m>76^{o}F.</m>

  Kelvin scale of temperature is the standard metric system of temperature measurement 
  and mostly used by scientists. The Kelvin scale has 100 equal degree increments between 
  the freezing point and the boiling point of water just as the Celsius scale. 
  However, the zero-degree mark on the Kelvin scale is 273.15 units cooler than 
  it is on the Celsius scale. So a temperature of 0 Kelvin is equivalent to a 
  temperature of <m>-273.15^{o}C.</m> Traditionally, degree symbol is not used with the 
  Kelvin scale. So a temperature of 300 units above 0 Kelvin is referred to as 300 Kelvin 
  and not 300 degree Kelvin. Hence  300 Kelvin is abbreviated as 300 K. Conversions among 
  Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales are summarized below.

  Consider these thermometers are placed in a cup of coffey where Celsius scale reads a temperature of C, 
  Fahrenheit scale reads a temperature of F, and Kelvin scale reads a temperature of K, 
  then we can find their relationship as follows
  <me>
    \frac{X-L}{U-L}=\frac{C-0}{100-0}=\frac{F-32}{212-32}=\frac{K-273}{373-273}
  </me>
  Here <m>X, \,U,</m> and <m>L</m> are unknown temperature, boiling point of water, and 
  freezing point of water in the respective thermometers, respectively. We have used here 
  freezing point of water as 273 K instead of 273.15 K, just for simplicity. 
  <me>
    \text{or,}\quad \frac{C}{100}=\frac{F-32}{180}=\frac{K-273}{100}
  </me>
  <men xml:id="eqn-therm1">
    \therefore\quad \frac{C}{5}=\frac{F-32}{9}=\frac{K-273}{5}
  </men>
  Eqn. <xref ref="eqn-therm1"/> provides the temperature conversion between any two scales. 
  Such as for Celsius/Kelvin scale,	
  <me>
    C  = ( K - 273)^{o} \,C,
  </me>
  <me>
    \text{and}\quad	K  =  (C + 273) \,K
  </me>
  For Fahrenheit/Celsius	scale,
  <me>
    F  = \left(\frac{9}{5} C  +  32\right)^{o}\,F
  </me>
  <me>
    \text{and}\quad C  = 5\left(\frac{F  - 32}{9} \right)^{o} \,C 
  </me>

  <title>Absolute Scale</title>

    A physical thermometer uses the 
    physical properties of a material or substance to determine temperature. 
    It relies on the fact that certain physical properties change in a predictable 
    way with temperature. Examples of physical thermometers include mercury-in-glass 
    thermometers, alcohol thermometers, and bimetallic strip thermometers. 
    These thermometers use the expansion and contraction of materials 
    (e.g., mercury or alcohol) to indicate temperature changes. 
    The scale of normal thermometers depends upon the physical propertise 
    (thermal expansion, electrical resistance, etc) of the substance which
    is used in the thermometer. The physical property (e.g. thermal expansion) 
    of materials varies differently at the different range of temperatures hence 
    all these thermometers have fixed uses. For example, 
    a mercury thermometer can measure temperature ranges from approximately 
    <m>-39^oC </m> to <m>356^oC</m> (<m>-38^oF</m> to <m>672^oF</m>). 
    For alcohol thermometer, the typical temperature range is approximately 
    <m>-115^oC</m> to <m>78^oC</m> (<m>-175^oF</m> to <m>172^oF</m>). 
    That means, if we go to <em>Antarctica</em> we must bring with us an alcohol 
    thermometer and when going to <em>Lut Desert</em> a hotest place on earth, we need a mercury thermometer. 
    Mercury thermometer may freeze in Antarctica and alcohol thermometer may boil in Lut Desert.
    To remedy such problems of limitation of physical thermometers, 
    Scottish physicist William Thomson, <m>1^{st}</m> Baron Kelvin proposed to constructing a 
    temperature scale which should be independent on the material properties on the basis of 
    thermodynamics principles that the lowest possible temperature which could be 
    achieved was <m>-273^{o}C,</m> in 1848. This minimum temperature is the zero 
    point on Kelvin scale and is known as <term>absolute zero</term>. 
    <em>Kelvin scale</em> is a hypothetical (theoretical) thermometer scale  
    also known as <em>absolute scale</em>.  
    <fn>From third law of thermodynamics, it is impossible to reach absolute zero temperature 
      by any physical means.

    Temperature is a measure of average kinetic energy per molecule of any substance. 
    In classical mechanical point of view, molecular motion ceases completely at 
    absolute zero and hence possesses zero kinetic energy. (However, in quantum mechanical 
    point if view, at absolute zero molecular motion takes minimum speed of its vibration.) 
    It has been seen from the gas laws that the product of pressure and volume is directly 
    proportional to temperature [<xref ref="abscale"/>]. In fact, all gases have energy (<m>pV</m>) 
    heading to zero at the same temperature called  absolute zero. At absolute zero 
    the pressure of an ideal gas would drop to zero.
