  <title>Center of Mass</title>
  
   <introduction>
    <p>
      The center of mass of a system of particles is a point in space at 
      which the net mass of the system seems to be located. It is the mean 
      position of the mass of a system or a body. <term>Center of gravity</term> 
      is an imaginary point in a body where the entire weight of the body may be 
      assumed to be concentrated or it is a point at which the gravity appears to act. 
      In a uniform gravitational field the center of gravity is identical to the 
      center of mass, but they do not coincide in a non-uniform gravitational field. 
      Imagine that you are lying horizontally in space above the planet where 
      you are experiencing a greater gravitational field strength towards your head 
      than towards your feet, then your center of gravity is located somewhere near 
      your shoulder rather than your belly button (i.e. navel or your center of mass). 
      The <term>center of gravity</term> (or center of mass) may coincide with a 
      geometric center of the body if it has a uniform mass distribution and possess 
      symmetrical shape. An asymmetrical object composed of a variety of materials 
      with different masses, however, has a center of gravity located at some distance 
      from its geometric center. In some cases, such as hollow bodies or irregularly 
      shaped objects, the center of gravity (or center of mass) may occur in space at 
      a point external to the physical material. For example, the center of mass of binary 
      stars lies between the stars and in the center of a tennis ball.

      The center of (mass) gravity (point <m>G</m>) of any body can be determined by 
      suspending the body by a cord attached at point <m>A</m> and then by a cord attached 
      at <m>C</m>. When the body is suspended from <m>A</m>, the line <m>AD</m> is vertical; 
      when it is suspended from <m>C</m>, the line <m>CE</m> is vertical. The center 
      of gravity is at the intersection of <m>AD</m> and <m>CE</m> [<xref ref="cmloct"/>]. 
      When an object is suspended from any single point, its center of gravity lies 
      directly beneath that point. For a group of discrete masses the location 
      of center of mass can be defined as:
      <me>
        r_{cm} =   \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{m_{i}r_{i}}}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{m_{i}}}
      </me>
      Vector position of center of mass.
    </p>
<p>
  or, 
  <me>
    r_{cm} =   \frac{\int\limits_{0}^{M}{r\,dm}}{\int\limits_{0}^{M}{\,dm}} =\frac{1}{\int\limits_{0}^{M} \,dm} \int\limits_{0}^{M}{r\,dm} = \frac{1}{M} \int\limits_{0}^{M}{r\,dm} 
  </me>
 or equivalently
 <me>
  x_{cm} =   \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{m_{i}x_{i}}}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{m_{i}}} = \frac{1}{M}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{m_{i}x_{i}}\quad \text{(x-component of center of mass)}
 </me>
 <me>
  y_{cm} =   \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{m_{i}y_{i}}}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{m_{i}}} =  \frac{1}{M}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{m_{i}y_{i}}\quad \text{(y-component of center of mass)}
 </me>
 <me>
  z_{cm} =   \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{m_{i}z_{i}}}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{m_{i}}} =  \frac{1}{M}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{m_{i}z_{i}}\quad \text{(z-component of center of mass)}
 </me>

  <term>Problem Solving Technique:</term> To determine the center of mass of a 
  uniformly distributed body, one performs the following steps:
  <ol>
    <li>
      Break the body down into its constituent parts.
    </li>
    <li>
      Specify the length, area, or volume of each constituent part.
    </li>
    <li>
      Locate the coordinates of the center of mass of each constituent part.
    </li>
    <li>
      Utilize the equations shown above using length, area, or volume in place of the mass.
      <me>
        e.g.,\quad x_{cm} =   \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{A_{i}x_{i}}}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{A_{i}}}
      </me>
      for a unifrom sheet
    </li>
    <li>
      If an object has a uniform mass distribution (uniform density), then its 
      geometric center is taken as center of mass.
    </li>
  </ol>
