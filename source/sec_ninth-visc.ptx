  <title>Viscosity</title>
  
   <introduction>
   <p>
    We may have experienced that pouring a cup of water or milk is much easier 
    than pouring a cup of honey or glycerin. Water or milk is less sticky than honey or glycerin. 
    On this experience, we can say that water like fluid is thinner and honey like fluid is thicker. 
    The property of fluids which makes them flow differently than one another is called viscosity. 
    Water has low viscosity, whereas honey has high viscosity. Actually there exists some kind of 
    friction between the adjacent layers of fluid when they flow. 
    <em>viscosity is an internal friction (or a drag force) between the adjacent layers of 
    fluid as they move past one another.</em> In liquids viscosity arises due to the cohesive 
    forces between their molecules, while in gases it arises due to the collision between their molecules.

      To understand viscosity more clearly, let us know about the types of fluids flow.
      <term>Laminar flow:</term> It is a smooth and continuous flow of the fluid in layers 
      that do not mix. <term>Turbulent flow: </term> It is the eddies and swirls that mix layers 
      of fluid together. In laminar flow layers of fluid flow without mixing and it follows the 
      same velocity and direction at every points of its motion, hence it is also called <em>streamlines 
      motion</em>. In turbulent flow streamlines break up and mix together and the fluid moves with changing 
      velocities and directions on every point of its path. Notice that viscosity causes drag between 
      layers as well as with the fixed surface. An obstruction in the vessel or speeding up fluid velocity 
      above a certain value leads to a turbulent flow.  <em>Reynolds number</em> is used to distinguish the 
      transition between laminar and turbulent flows.

    <title>Coefficient of Viscosit</title>
    <p>
      If we observe the flow of water in a river flowing continuously and smoothly, 
      we will be able to notice that water near the edge of the river flows slower than 
      the water flowing near the middle of the river. When a fluid is flowing past a stationary wall, 
      the fluid right close to the wall is almost at rest but the fluid away from the wall flows 
      with relatively higher speed. So a velocity gradient exists between layers in fluid flow. 
      This is due to adhesive, cohesive, and frictional forces acting between adjacent layers of the fluid. 
      The <em>velocity gradient</em> (i.e., the change in speed with distances) is a characteristic 
      of the fluid. This is used to define the coefficient of viscosity <m>\eta.</m> 
      We limit our discussion here only on laminar flow of liquid.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="visco1"/> a layer <m>A</m> has higher speed than its adjacent layer <m>B</m>, 
      so layer A applies force on B to move it faster, but layer B pushes layer A backward so 
      that they go together. Such pushing and pulling between the layers creates a drag force 
      called a <term>viscous force</term>. Consider a shear force F is required to keep the 
      layer of fluid  moving at a constant velocity v, then it can be observed through 
      the experiments that this force depends on the following four factors. This force <m>F</m> 
      <ol marker="i.">
        <li>
          is proportional to velocity of the layer of liquid (<m>F \propto v, </m>),
        </li>
        <li>
          is proportional to the surface area of layer having the velocity v (<m>F \propto A,</m>) 
        </li>
        <li>
          is inversely proportional to the distance of the layer from the stationary wall  (<m>F \propto \frac{1}{L}.</m>) 
          Mathematically, 
          <me>
            F\propto \frac{vA}{L} 
          </me>
          <me>
            \therefore \quad F= \eta\frac{vA}{L} 
          </me>
          
        </li>
      </ol>
    If <m>\,dz</m> is the distance between adjacent layers and <m>\,dv</m> is the difference in their velocities, 
    then the viscous force is given in differential form as 
    <me>
      F= \eta A\frac{\,dv}{\,dz}
    </me>
    where, <m>\eta </m> is a proportionality constant, called coefficient of viscosity 
    and it defines the property of the fluid. The greater the coefficient of viscosity <m>\eta</m>, 
    the greater the force required to move the layer of fluid at a velocity v. 
    The term <m>\frac{\,dv}{\,dz}</m> is called a velocity gradient. The fluids which obey 
    this equation are called <em>Newtonian fluids</em> and <m>\eta = constant</m> 
    is independent of the speed of flow. If <m>\eta </m> does depend on the velocity of 
    flow the fluids are called <em>non-Newtonian</em>. Blood is an example of a non-Newtonian fluid. 
    <me>
      \because \quad \eta= \frac{FL}{vA}
    </me>
    The SI unit of viscosity is <m> N.s/m^{2}</m> or, <m>Pa.s</m>. 
    A common unit of viscosity is the poise <m>P</m> where <m>1 \,Pa.s = 10 \,P.</m> 
    </p>
    <p>
      Viscosity is temperature dependent. Viscosity of a liquid decreases with increasing temperature 
      and that for a gas increases with increasing temperature.

      Liquid could flow in a tube freely but because of viscosity it needs pressure difference 
      between the ends of the tube to flow. The rate of flow of fluid in a tube is dependent 
      on its viscosity, pressure difference between the two ends of the tube (or, pressure gradient), 
      and the radius of the tube. Posiseuille assume the laminar flow of incompressible fluid 
      (mostly liquid) to obtain the Poiseuille's equation.

        As the body falls through a medium, its velocity goes on increasing due to gravity. 
        As the viscous force is velocity dependent, it also goes on goes on increasing till 
        it reaches a constant velocity called terminal velocity. This happen when the weight 
        of the body is just equal to the sum of the upward thrust due to buoyancy and the 
        upward viscous drag. At this stage, there is no net force to accelerate the body. 
        Let <m>\rho </m> be the density of the material of the spherical body of radius r 
        and <m>\sigma</m> be the density of the medium. Hence,
