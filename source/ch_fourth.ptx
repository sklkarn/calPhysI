  <title>Force and Equilibrium</title>
    
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Force is that external agency which when acts on a body, it changes its mechanical state. 
      Meaning it changes its shape or its state of being in rest or in motion, or its  direction of motion. 
      It is also called a push or pull. It is a vector quantity. The branch of physics which deals 
      with the effect of force and motion on an object is called a <term>mechanics</term>. 
      Mechanics has basically three parts, kinematics, statics, and dynamics. 
      The study of motion without knowing the cause (force and energy) of motion is 
      called kinematics. Statics is the physics of stationary objects or an object 
      moving with constant velocity. Dynamics is the physics of moving objects 
      under the action of forces, i.e., <m>F_{net} \neq 0</m> in transnational dynamics,  
      or, <m>\tau_{net} \neq 0</m> in rotational dynamics.
