      A particle is moving according to the equation 
      <me>
        \vec{r}  =  (A t + B t^{2})\hat{i} + C t^{3}\hat{j},
      </me>

      A boy uses a sling to throw a rock a distance of 100 m. If the rock is in the air for  5 s, 
      find each of the following: 
      <ol marker="a.">
        <li>
          How fast is the rock initially traveling horizontally?
        </li>
        <li>How fast is the rock initially traveling vertically? </li>
        <li> How high does the rock get? </li>
        <li>How fast does it hit the ground?</li>
        <li>At what angle does it hit the ground?</li>

    <p>
      A hang glider is flying in a horizontal circle of radius 20 m, 
      completing the circle in a time period of 10 s. 
      <ol marker="a.">
        <li>
          What is the speed of the glider?
        </li>
        <li>What is the tangential acceleration of the glider? </li>
        <li> What is the radial acceleration of the glider? </li>
        <li>Express this last answer in g's of acceleration.</li>
        <li>How many g's of force would the pilot be experiencing? Would this be noticeable?</li>

    <p>
      A boy uses a sling to throw a rock across the field by whirling the rock in 
      a vertical circle of radius 0.5 m and frequency 2 Hz. If the rock is released 
      when the sling makes an angle of <m>30^{o}</m> below the horizontal when the 
      rock is at a height of 1 m above the ground, 
      <ol marker="a.">
        <li>
          how high will the rock rise above the ground and
        </li>
        <li>how far will it travel horizontally before hitting the ground? </li>
         </ol>
       </p>

    <p>
      A fighter plane is flying horizontally at an altitude of 1.5 km with speed 
      720 km/h. At what angle of sight (w.r.t. horizontal) when the target is 
      seen, should the pilot drop the bomb in order to attack the target ?

    <p>
      If the golf ball is hit in the direction of a <m>12 m</m> tree which is <m>80 m</m> from the
      golfer, will the ball pass over the tree or hit it?

  <exercise>
    <p>
      Suppose a tennis player hits a ball when it is at a height of 1.5 m giving it a 
      velocity of 15 m/s at an angle of <m>10^{o}</m> to the horizontal. Find when and 
      where the ball will hit the ground.

    <p>
      A footballer kicks a ball on horizontal ground giving it an initial velocity 
      of 25 m/s at an angle of <m>35^{o}</m> to the horizontal. 
      <ol marker="a.">
        <li>
          Where will the ball be 1.2 seconds after it is kicked?
        </li>
        <li>What will be the greatest height reached by the ball? </li>
        <li>Where will the ball land? </li>

  <exercise>
    <p>
      A ball is kicked at an angle <m>\theta = 45^{o}</m>. It is intended that the 
      ball lands in the back of a moving truck which has a trunk of length L = 2.5 m. 
      If the initial horizontal distance from the back of the truck to the ball, 
      at the instant of the kick, is <m>d_{o} = 5 m</m>, and the truck moves directly 
      away from the ball at velocity <m>v = 9 m/s</m> (as shown), what is the maximum 
      and minimum velocity <m>v_{o}</m> so that the ball lands in the trunk. 
      Assume that the initial height of the ball is equal to the height of 
      the ball at the instant it begins to enter the trunk.

    <p>
      An athlete releases the shot at 1.82 m above the ground and its initial velocity is <m>v_{o} =
        13.6 m/s</m>. Determine the horizontal distance the shot travels from the point 
        of release to the point where it hits the ground.

      A pilot wants to drop survey markers at remote locations. If he flies at a 
      constant velocity <m>v_{o} = 40 m/s</m> at altitude <m>h = 30 m</m> and 
      the marker is released with zero velocity relative to the plane, at what 
      horizontal distance <m>d</m> from the desired impact point should the marker be released?

      A point P moves along the spiral path <m>r = (0.1)\theta,</m> here <m>\theta</m> is in radian. 
      The angular position <m>\theta = 2t</m> rad, where t is in seconds, and r = 0 at t = 0. 
      Determine the magnitudes of the velocity and acceleration of P at t = 1 s.
