  <title>Elasticity</title>
    
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The property of a material by virtue of which it regains its original shape and size 
      after removal of deforming force is known as elasticity. The elastic properties of 
      matter are a manifestation of the molecular forces that hold solids together. 
      Elasticity is a fundamental concept in the study of the mechanical behavior of 
      solids and is related to the deformation and restoration of materials when subjected to stress or strain. 
      A regular, periodically repeated, three-dimensional array of the atoms or molecules comprising 
      the solid are called <term>lattice structure</term>.
