    A towline used to tow hang gliders is 500 m long and <m>10 mm^{2} </m> in cross-sectional area. 
    It is found to stretch 10 m under a tension equal to one-fourth the weight of an 100 kg glider-pilot 
    combination. What is Young's modulus for the material used to make the towline?

    A brass wire <m>(Yb = 9\times 10^{10} \,Pa)</m> and a steel wire <m>(Ys = 20\times 10^{10} \,Pa)</m> 
    are both used (in parallel) to support a single mass of 1000 kg. Both wires have a length of 2 m 
    and a cross-sectional area of <m>1 mm^{2}</m>.

    The deepest part of the ocean is about 11 km and has a pressure of about 1000 atm. 
    If the bulk modulus of sea water is <m>2.2\times 10^{9} \,Pa</m> and the surface density 
    of sea water is <m>1.03\times 10^{3} \,kg/m^{2}</m>, what is the density of sea 
    water at the bottom of the ocean?

    A horizontal rod of negligible mass and of length 1 m is supported on each end by a 
    wire of length 1 m and diameter 0.1 mm. The wire on the left has a diameter of 0.1 mm 
    and is made of aluminum <m>(Y = 7.0\times 10^{10} \,N/m^{2})</m>. The wire on the the right 
    has a diameter of 0.2 mm and is made of copper <m>(Y = 11\times 10^{10} \,N/m^{2})</m>. 
    A mass of 1 kg is then suspended from the rod.

      <li>
        Where should the mass be located in order to produce equal stresses in the two wires?

    Find the ratio of the density of water at the bottom of a 50.0 m lake to the density 
    of water at the surface of the lake. The pressure at the bottom of the lake is <m>4.90 \times 10^{5} \,N/m^{2}.</m>
