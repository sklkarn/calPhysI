  <title>Rigid Body</title>
    
  <introduction>
    <p>
      A body which does not deform (i.e., the distance between two points never changes) 
      under the influence of forces is known as a rigid body. However, there is no such 
      thing as a perfect rigid body in real life. Practically all bodies deform somewhat 
      more or less with the applied force.  A rigid body conserves its shape under the action 
      of external forces. A concrete pillar, a dead snake, bones, etc can be considered 
      as  rigid bodies. In rigid body a physics of real object is described for its 
      real dimension not as we have described physics earlier for an object by 
      considering it as a point mass.

        The movement of a rigid body not fixed to an axis shows a translation motion while 
        a body with fixed axis shows a combination of translational and rotational motion. 
        In translational motion all the particles of a system have same velocity and acceleration 
        as the velocity and acceleration of its center of mass. In rotational motion different 
        particles of a body moves in different circular paths with all their centers lie on a point 
        of rotation. The straight line that is passing through the point of rotation and perpendicular 
        to the plane of circular paths is called an axis of rotation. In rotational motion every 
        particle of the system follows the same angular velocity but has different tangential velocities 
        which depends upon their position from the axis of rotation. The further the particle from 
        the axis of rotation, the higher will be their tangential velocities. The angular measurements 
        is described in radian rather than degree in the rigid body. In <xref ref="rb1"/>, angular velocity, 
        <m>\omega</m>  is pointed along the axis of rotation which is given by the right 
        hand thumb's rule, where if fingers of right hand are curled in the direction of 
        rotation then thumb is directed along the angular velocity. Point <m>O</m> is a point 
        of rotation and the tangential velocities of particles <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are given as 
        <m>\vec{v}_{1}</m> and <m>\vec{v}_{2},</m> respectively where  magnitude of 
        <m>\vec{v}_{2} \gt \vec{v}_{1}.</m>
