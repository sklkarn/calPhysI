      In order to protect vehicles on a curvy road to skid outward, 
      the road is slanted towards its outer edge which is called the 
      banking of a curve. As the speed of vehicle increases, the centripetal 
      force needed for circular motion of the vehicle also increases. 
      On the level road the frictional force between tire and the road 
      provides the necessary centripetal force <xref ref="subsubsec-cent_accel"/> but as the speed increases 
      this friction is not sufficient enough to provide required centripetal 
      force which results in skid  the vehicle off the road in opposite direction 
      of the curve. To avoid such calamity the road is banked so that tire has 
      protection from skidding upward. Due to banking necessary centripetal force 
      is provided by the components of  frictional force and normal force. 
      Since the frictional force acts on a running tire and road is static 
      in nature (unless it skids), it is directed towards upper edge of the 
      slanted road if the car is running with low velocity or at rest. 
      However the frictional force acts towards lower edge of road if the car 
      has high velocity because the car has tendency to skid towards upper edge of the road.
