  <title>Fluid Statics</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Fluid statics is a branch of fluid mechanics that deals with the behavior of stationary (non-moving) fluids, 
      typically liquids and gases, under the influence of gravitational forces. It focuses on the study of fluids 
      at rest and how they exert pressure and forces on their surroundings.

    <title>Pascal's Principle</title>
    
<introduction>
  <p>
    Pascal's principle states that pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted equally 
    to every portion of the fluid and the walls of the container. This principle is valid only 
    for an incompressible fluid which is most of the liquid. <term>Hydraulic press</term> <idx><h>hydraulic press</h></idx>
    is one of the good examples of Pascal's principle.  It is a device to lift  heavy objects. 
    It has two cylindrical opening attached the horizontal tube as shown in <xref ref="hpress"/>. 
    An incompressible liquid is filled in the device. It works on Pascal's principle and obeys 
    the conservation of energy. Work done on the a pump (small cylindrical piston) to push it 
    down is equal to the work done by the big piston to lift heavy objects like vehicle, elephant, etc. 
    Let a force <m>F_{1}</m> is applied on one piston to push it to a distance <m>\,dx_{1} </m> 
    then it lifts the weight <m>F_{2}</m> to a distance <m>\,dx_{2}</m> on the other pan attached to the second piston.

  </me>
  
  <men xml:id="eqn-pascl3">
   \Rightarrow \quad  F_{2} = \frac{A_{2}}{A_{1}}F_{1}

  Since area of cross-section,<m> A_{2}</m> is greater than  area of cross-section, <m>A_{1}</m> 
  a small force <m>F_{1}</m>  can generate a compressive force <m> F_{2}.</m>

  <title>Measurement of Fluid Pressure</title>
  <p>
    Pressure measurement is important in many occasions in our daily life. 
    To check tire pressure, pressure in balloon filled with air, pressure inside a pipe carrying fluid, 
    pressure in gas cylinder, pressure in boiler used in industries, and pressure inside an airplane cabin. 
    Two basic types of pressure measuring devices have been discussed here.
  </p>
<ol marker="i.">
  <li>
    <p>
    <term>Manometer:</term> <idx><h>manometer</h></idx>
    Manometer is is a U-shaped tube used to measure pressure of a fluid at rest. It contains water, 
    mercury, or any other suitable fluid in the tube. When a pressure line is connected to one column 
    of manometer, the fluid in the column will be forced down, and the fluid in the other will rise as 
    shown in <xref ref="manometer"/>. By measuring the difference in height of the fluid in the two columns, 
    the pressure of the inlet can be expressed in length.

      p_{C} =p_{B}+\rho_{1}gh_{1} 
    </me>
    <me>
      p_{C} =p_{A}+\rho_{1}gh_{1} =p_{D}

      \therefore\quad p_{A,abs} = p_{o} +\rho_{2}gh_{2} -\rho_{1}gh_{1} 
    </me>
    <me>
      \therefore\quad p_{A,gauge} = \rho_{2}gh_{2} -\rho_{1}gh_{1} 
    </me>
  Here <m> p_{o}</m> is an atmospheric pressure acting on the open end of manometer, 
  <m>\rho_{1}</m>  and <m>\rho_{2} </m> are densities of fluids in container A and in U-tube, 
  respectively. Pressure at points A and B are same and the pressure at points C and D are same. 
  Hence pressure in column BC is balanced by pressure in column DE.

    <p>
      <term>Barometer</term> <idx><h>barometer</h></idx> 
      It is the simplest pressure gauge used for measuring atmospheric pressure. 
      It is designed by  <em>Torricelli</em>. A meter long tube completely filled 
      with mercury is inverted in a mercury container in such a way that the open end of 
      the tube is under the pool of mercury. Now on balancing the atmospheric pressure 
      acting on the mercury container the mercury column in the tube drops to a certain 
      height and creating a complete vacuum at the top of the tube and hence the pressure 
      is zero at point C. In the <xref ref="barometer"/>, points A and B are at the same level so they 
      have the same pressure.

    </me>
          This device measures atmospheric pressure, rather than gauge pressure, 
          because there is a nearly pure vacuum above the mercury in the tube.

  <title>Archimedes' Principle</title>
  <p>
    When an object is placed in a fluid it experiences an upthrust force called a <term>buoyant force</term>. 
    It is arising due to changes of the pressure inside fluid. This phenomenon is known as 
    Archimedes' principle. It states that <em> when a body is fully or partially immersed in a fluid, 
      the fluid exerts an upward force on the body equal to the weight of liquid displaced </em>. 
      That is, buoyant force (B) = weight of displaced fluid.
      <me>
        B  =  w_{df}
      </me>
          Liquid does not distinguish between the volume of its own or the volume of some 
          thing else. Meaning if we replace some arbitrary volume of the liquid with some other 
          object of the same volume then the liquid applies the same force on its surface, <xref ref="arcmds"/> and <xref ref="arcmdsb"/>.

  <p>
  If <m>m_{df}</m> and <m> V_{df}</m> are the mass and volume of displaced fluid and <m>\rho_{f} </m>  
  is the density of fluid then weight of displaced fluid is given by 
  <me>
    m_{df}g = V_{df}\rho_{f} g =B
  </me>
  Due to buoyant force body appear lighter than it really is. Hence, the weight of a body in the 
  fluid is called an apparent weight.  Weight loss of a body is equal to weight of liquid displaced. That is,
  <me>
    B= W_{a}-W_{f}=\text{apparent loss in weight}
  </me>
  Where <m>W_{a}</m> and <m>W_{f}</m> are weight of a body in air and in the fluid, respectively. 
  Apparent weight is the net downward force. 
    </p>
  <p> Hence apparent loss in weight = buoyant force = weight of water displaced.</p>
  <p>
    If an object floats, then its apparent weight is zero. If its apparent weight is more than zero, 
    it sinks. A floating object loss  all of its weight.

    <ol marker="i.">
      <li>
        If the body is completely submerged but suspended in the fluid [<xref ref="arcmdsc"/>], 
        then from Newton's second law net force acting on the body is zero. 
        That is, buoyant force is equal to weight of the body
        <me>
          B=m_{b}g
        </me>
        <me>
          \text{or,}\quad V_{df}\rho_{f} g  = V_{b}\rho_{b} g 
        </me>
             Since body is completely immersed in the fluid, <m>V_{b}=V_{df}</m>.  Hence,
             <me>
              \text{or,}\quad V_{b}\rho_{f} g  = V_{b}\rho_{b} g  
             </me>
             <me>
              \therefore \quad  \rho_{f} = \rho_{b}
             </me>
               The body will suspend in a fluid if their densities are same. 
      </li>
      <li>
        If the body is floating in the fluid [<xref ref="arcmdsd"/>], then buoyant force is 
        greater than the weight of the body.  Hence body comes to a float, but at the surface 
        of the fluid, net force acting on the body is zero.
        <me>
          B=m_{b}g
        </me>
        <me>
          \text{or,}\quad V_{df}\rho_{f} g  = V_{b}\rho_{b} g
        </me>
         Since body is floating in the fluid, volume of the displaced fluid is 
         then only equal to immersed portion of the body. Hence <m> V_{df} \lt V_{b}.</m>
         <me>
          \text{or,}\quad \frac{\rho_{f}}{\rho_{b}}  = \frac{V_{b}}{V_{df}} \gt 1 
         </me>
         <me>
          \therefore \quad  \rho_{f} \gt \rho_{b} 
         </me>
         The body will float in a fluid if the densities of fluid is greater than that of the body.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the body is sinking in the fluid [<xref ref="arcmdse"/>], then buoyant force is less 
        than the weight of the body.  Hence body sinks, but at the bottom of the fluid, net force 
        acting on the body is zero.
        <me>
          B+N=mg
        </me>
        <me>
          \text{or,}\quad N= mg-B = V_{b}\rho_{b}g-V_{df}\rho_{f}g = V_{b}[\rho_{b}-\rho_{f}]g
        </me>
        Since <m>V_{b}=V_{df}.</m> Hence for <m>N</m> to be +ve, <m>\rho_{b}-\rho_{f}</m> must be positive. 
        Here <m>N</m> is the apparent weight of the body in the fluid. 
        <me>
          \therefore\quad \rho_{f} \lt \rho_{b}
