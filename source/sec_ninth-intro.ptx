    There are three states of equilibrium:

          <term>Stable equilibrium:</term> The body is said to be in stable equilibrium 
          if its center of gravity lies below lowest possible position. A funnel standing 
          vertically on its base on the table is in stable equilibrium [<xref ref="funnel1"/>]. 
          If the funnel is tilted a little bit against any side and then allowed to fall, 
          it will come back to its original position. When the funnel is tilted against 
          any side its center of gravity is raised [<xref ref="funnel1a"/>]. The line of action 
          of weight passes through the base of the funnel. As long as the line of action 
          of weight remains inside the base area funnel will come back to the original position. 
          A torque due to weight of the funnel brings it back to the original position. 
          For the funnel to tip over the line of action of the weight arrow will have to 
          form a clockwise moment (or to pass outside the point of support). 
          The funnel needs to have been pushed a lot for tip over. Some examples of 
          stable equilibrium are bodies lying on the floor such as chair, table, book, etc. 
          If a system in stable equilibrium is disturbed slightly, it oscillates around 
          that state first but eventually settles down in exactly the same position as it 
          started [<xref ref="funnel1b"/>]. It does this because its center of gravity is already 
          at the lowest possible position.

            <term>Unstable equilibrium:</term> The body is said to be in unstable equilibrium 
            if the center of gravity of a body lies above the highest possible position. 
            A funnel standing vertically on its stem on the table [<xref ref="funnel2"/>] is in 
            unstable equilibrium. If the funnel standing vertically is slightly disturbed 
            from its position it will not come back to its original position rather fall 
            down on the surface of table. when the funnel is slightly disturbed its 
            center of gravity is lowered [<xref ref="funnel2a"/>]. The line of action of its 
            weight lies outside the base of stem. The torque due to weight of the rod 
            toppled it down. Other examples of unstable equilibrium are vertically standing 
            cylinder and pencil etc. An unstable system moves away from its original equilibrium 
            state when disturbed. It wants to move away from the original position as 
            soon as it has been disturbed [<xref ref="funnel2b"/>]. It does this because its center 
            of gravity is higher in this state and when disturbed the center of gravity 
            continues to move to a lower position (a more stable one).

            <term>Neutral equilibrium:</term>  The body is said to be in neutral equilibrium 
            if the center of gravity of a body is at optimal position it is neither lowered 
            nor is raised up. The object with lower center of gravity is more stable than 
            the one with the higher center of gravity. A funnel lying horizontally on its 
            side at rest on the surface of a table [<xref ref="funnel3"/>] is in natural equilibrium. 
            If a funnel is pushed slightly to roll, it will neither come back to its original position
            nor it will roll forward rather it will remain at rest. If the funnel is rolled, 
            its center of gravity is neither raised nor lowered [<xref ref="funnel3a"/>]. 
            This means that its center of gravity  is at the same height as before. 
            A neutral system is one where the center of gravity of the system is always at 
            the same level. If it has been disturbed slightly it will therefore settle in 
            the new position without a need to move further on or to move back [<xref ref="funnel3b"/>]. 
            For example, a rolling ball lying on the table.
