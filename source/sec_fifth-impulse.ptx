  <title>Impulse and Momentum</title>
  
   <introduction>
    <p>
      The quantity of motion contained in a body is known as <term>momentum</term>. 
      It is defined as the product of mass and velocity of a body. It is a vector quantity. 
      <me>
        \vec{p}=m\vec{v}
      </me>
      Its unit is <m>kg m/s^{2}</m> in SI system. The momentum has same direction 
      as velocity of the object. There are two types of momentum, linear momentum and 
      angular momentum. The object moving with a linear velocity, <m>v</m> has linear 
      momentum and the object spinning with angular velocity, <m>\omega</m> possesses 
      angular momentum. Here only linear momentum (normally called momentum) is being discussed. 
      The momentum of a system of particles is the sum of the momenta of the individual particles. 
      <me>
        \vec{p}_{tot}=\sum_{i} m_{i}\vec{v}_{i}
      </me>
          From Newton's II law of motion, force acting on a particle is the rate 
          of change of momentum and its direction is along that change  
          <me>
            \vec{F}_{tot}=\frac{\,d\vec{p}}{\,dt} 
          </me>
                For a system of particles total force can be,
                <me>
                  \vec{F}_{tot}=\sum_{i}\vec{F}_{i}=\sum_{i}\frac{\,d\vec{p}_{i}}{\,dt} = \frac{\,d\vec{p}_{tot}}{\,dt} 
                </me>
              </p>

              <p>
                In this expression 
                <me>
                  \sum_{i}\vec{F}_{i}=\sum_{i}\vec{F}^{ext}_{i}
                </me>
                because the internal forces are Newton's III law pairs and they are 
                directed along the lines between particles of the system and hence cancel 
                each other out. Therefore, the total force acting on the system is 
                <me>
                  \vec{F}_{tot} = \sum_{i}\vec{F}^{ext}_{i}  =\frac{\,d\vec{p}_{tot}}{\,dt}
                </me>
                <me>
                  \text{or,}\quad \vec{p}_{tot} =\int\,d\vec{p}_{tot}= \int\vec{F}_{tot}\,dt
                </me>
                A force acting on an object for a certain time changes the momentum of 
                that object, such change in momentum is called <term>Impulse</term>. 
                If total external force acting on a system  is zero, then total linear 
                momentum of the system, 
                <me>
                  \vec{p}_{tot} = constant.
                </me>
                This is known as the <term>principle of conservation of momentum</term>. That is 
                <me>
                  \vec{p}_{tot} =\vec{p}_{i}=\vec{p}_{f}
                </me>
                where <m>\vec{p}_{i}</m> and <m>\vec{p}_{f}</m> are the initial and final 
                momenta of a system. Momentum conservation is very useful in collision 
                problems because the collision force is internal and hence does not change the total momentum.
              </p>
              <p>The impulse of a collision is the total momentum transferred during the collision, 
                where a collision is an event where a very large force is exerted over a very short 
                time interval <m>\Delta t</m>. During that interval magnitude of force is 
                continuously changing, Therefore, the impulse of a force is the product of the 
                average force and the time interval during which the force acts. That is, 
                <me>
                  \vec{J}=\vec{F}_{av}\,dt=\,d\vec{p}
                </me>
                where, 
                <me>
                  \vec{F}_{av} = \frac{1}{\Delta t}\int\limits_{0}^{t}\vec{F}\,dt
                </me>
                Impulse is a vector quantity and has the same direction as the average force. Unit of impulse is Ns.

    <title>Collision</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        A collision <idx><h>collision</h></idx> is an interaction between two objects 
        that may or may not have made physical contact. In  a collision the colliding objects 
        experience a pair of forces acting on them. The direction of the force on the first 
        object is opposite to the direction of the force on the second object and these 
        forces are equal in magnitude. These forces are Newton's III law pair. In an isolated system, 
        total momentum is always conserved, hence such forces often increase the momentum of one 
        object and decrease the momentum of the other. There are two kinds of collisions, elastic 
        collision and inelastic collision.
      </p>
      <p>Total energy is always conserved in any types of collision. In collision three 
        steps are considered to understand the problems. They are <em>before collision:</em> 
        objects approach each other with a kinetic energy due to their movement, 
        <em>during collision:</em> objects interact and transfer their momentum. 
        The kinetic energy is transformed into elastic potential energy stored in the 
        spring-like molecular bonds, and <em>after collision:</em> the stored elastic 
        potential energy is converted into kinetic energy as the objects move away from each other [<xref ref="col1d"/>].
      </p>

      <p>
        Here <m>u_{1}, \quad u_{2}, \quad v_{1}, </m> and <m>v_{2}</m> are velocities 
        of body 1 and 2 before and after collision, respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider two objects of mass <m>m_1</m> and <m>m_2</m> having velocity <m>u_{1}</m> 
        and  <m>u_{2}</m>, respectively are moving in 1-dimension and that <m>u_{1} \gt  u_{2}</m> 
        so that they collide along their way. Suppose that both objects are subject 
        to zero net force unless they are in contact with one another. During the collision, 
        the first object exerts a large transitory force <m>f_{21}</m> on the second, 
        whereas the second object exerts an equal and opposite force <m>f_{12}=-f_{21}</m> 
        on the first. That is, they transfer equal and opposite impulses on one another 
        at the instant of collision. If <m>v_{1}</m> and <m>v_{2}</m> are the velocity 
        of the objects after collision, and there is no external force acting on the objects 
        then from the principle of conservation of momentum, we have 
        <me>
          p_{before} =p_{after}
        </me>
        <men xml:id="eqn-col1">
          \therefore \quad m_{1}u_{1} +m_{2}u_{2} = m_{1}v_{1}+m_{2}v_{2}  
        </men>
    This equation is valid for any 1-dimensional collision, irrespective of its nature.

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-ineleast_col">
      <title>Inelastic Collision</title>
      <p>
        A collision in which <em>total momentum is conserved</em> but the 
        <em>total kinetic energy is not conserved</em> before and after the collision 
        is known as inelastic collision. That is, some of their kinetic energy is converted 
        into heat, or sound, or deformation. If the two objects stick together after the 
        collision and move with a common velocity <m>v_{f},</m> then the collision is 
        said to be perfectly inelastic. Most collisions in practice are inelastic. Perfectly 
        inelastic collisions usually involve easily deformed obj
        ects e.g. wet clay. 
        Since momentum is conserved in an inelastic collision eqn. <xref ref="eqn-col1"/> can help solve 
        the problem. In <em>perfectly inelastic collision</em>, <m>v_{1} =v_{2}=v </m> 
        after the collision, hence from eqn. <xref ref="eqn-col1"/>, we have -
        <me>
          m_{1}u_{1} +m_{2}u_{2} = \left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right)v

      <title>Elastic Collision</title>
      <p>
        A collision in which <em>total momentum and total kinetic energy  are conserved</em> 
        before and after the collision is known as elastic collision. That is there is 
        no dissipative force acting during the collision and that all of the kinetic energy 
        of the objects before the collision is still in the form of kinetic energy afterward. 
        Any macroscopic collision between objects will convert some of the kinetic energy 
        into internal energy and other forms of energy, so no large scale impacts are perfectly 
        elastic. Elastic collisions usually involve sub-atomic particles or highly rigid objects 
        e.g. steel or glass balls. If both objects have same mass, their velocities swap 
        after perfectly elastic collision, e.g. Newton's cradle.  "Collisions" in which 
        the objects do not touch each other, such as Rutherford scattering or the 
        slingshot orbit of a satellite off a planet, are elastic collisions. 
        In atomic or nuclear scattering, the collisions are typically elastic because 
        the repulsive Coulomb force keeps the particles out of contact with each other. 
        Collisions in ideal gases are very nearly elastic, and this fact is used in the 
        development of the expressions for gas pressure in a container. Since total 
        momentum and total kinetic energy is conserved in elastic collision, eqn. <xref ref="eqn-col1"/>
        along with eqn. <xref ref="eqn-col2"/> can help solve the problem,

      <p>
        The coefficient of restitution, <m>e</m> is defined as the ratio of 
        relative speeds after and before an impact, taken along the line of impact.  
        If <m>v_{sep}</m> represents how fast the objects are separating from one another after collision,

        If the magnitude of the final relative velocity  is less than the magnitude 
        of the initial relative velocity, <m>e \lt 1,</m> then the change in kinetic

        inelastic collisions, <m>\Delta K \lt 0</m>. If the two objects stick together 
        after the collision, then the relative final velocity is zero, <m>e = 0.</m> 
        Such collisions are called totally inelastic. If the magnitude of the final
