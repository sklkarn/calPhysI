    <p>
      A fluid moves along length 0.75 m with velocity 2m/s and has shearing stress of 
      <m>2 \,N/m^{2}</m>. Calculate its viscosity.

 Given: Velocity, v = 2m/s, length, L = 0.75 m, shearing stress, <m>p = 2 N/m^{2}.</m>
    </p>
<p>
  The shearing stress is given by,
<me>
  F = \eta A \frac{v}{L}
</me>
<me>
  \text{or,} p =\frac{F}{A} =\eta \frac{v}{L}

      A plate 0.025 mm apart from a fixed plate moves at 60 cm/s and requires force of <m>2 \,N/m^{2}</m> 
      to maintain the speed. Determine the fluid viscosity between the plates.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      Given: Velocity, v = 60 cm/s = 0.6m/s, length, L = 0.025 mm = <m>0.025\times 10^{-3}m</m>, shearing stress, <m>p = 2 N/m^{2}.</m>

The shearing stress is given by,

  F = \eta A \frac{v}{L}
</me>
<me>
  \text{or,} \quad p =\frac{F}{A} =\eta \frac{v}{L}
</me>

      The space between two flat parallel plates is filled with an oil. 
      Each side of the plate is 60 cm. The thickness of the oil plate is 12.5 mm. The 
      upper plate which moves at 2.55 m/s requires a force of 98.1 N to maintain the speed. 
      Determine, the dynamic viscosity of oil in cP.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
Given: b=60 cm=0.6 m, L=12.5 mm = <m>12.5\times 10^{-3} m</m>,  v=2.55 m/s,  F = 98.1 N, and <m> A=b^{2} = 0.6 = 0.36 m^{2}.</m>

        F = \eta A \frac{v}{L}
      </me>
      <me>
        \therefore \quad \eta = \frac{FL}{Av} =\frac{98.1 \,N\times 12.5\times 10^{-3} \,m}{0.36\, m^{2}\times 2.55 \,m/s}

  <statement>
    <p>
      The flow of blood through a large artery extending from heart to lungs with a radius of 
      2.5 mm and is found to be 15 cm long. The pressure across the artery ends is found 
      to be 380 Pa then what is the blood's average speed?
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      The blood viscosity <m>\eta = 0.0027 \,N.s/m^{2},</m> the arterial radius, 
      <m>r= 2.5 \,mm=2.5\times 10^{-3} \,m</m>, the artery length, <m>l= 10 \,cm=0.10 \,m</m>, 
      and the difference of pressure, <m>\Delta p= 380 Pa</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The volume flow rate is given by 
      <me>
        \frac{\,dV}{\,dt} = \left(\frac{\pi \Delta p}{8\eta l}\right)r^{4} 
      </me>
      The volume flow rate is also given by 
      <me>
        \frac{\,dV}{\,dt} = Av = \pi r^{2}v
      </me>
   From these equantions, we get the velocity of blood flow as 
   <me>
    \pi r^{2}v = \left(\frac{\pi \Delta p}{8\eta l}\right)r^{4} 
   </me>
   <me>
    \therefore\quad v = \left(\frac{r^{2} }{8\eta l}\right)\Delta p
   </me>
   <me>
    = \left(\frac{0.0025^{2} \,m^{2}}{8(0.0027 \,Ns/m^{2}) (0.10 \,m)}\right)(380 \,N/m^{2})= 1.099 \,m/s

  <statement>
    <p>
      A total volume of 3 ml of a viscous fluid is delivered into a patient in 10 s. 
      When the needle is changed, 3 ml of the same fluid takes 8 s to be delivered 
      into the patient under the identical conditions. If the radius of the original 
      needle was 0.3 mm, what is the radius of the new needle?
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      The volume flow rate is given by 
      <me>
        \frac{\,dV}{\,dt} = \left(\frac{\pi \Delta p}{8\eta l}\right)r^{4} 
      </me>
      <me>
        \text{or,}\quad \left(\frac{\pi \Delta p}{8\eta l}\right) = \frac{\frac{\,dV}{\,dt}}{r^{4}}=\frac{3 ml}{10 s\times 0.3^{4} mm^{4}}
      </me>
      <me>
        \therefore\quad \left(\frac{\pi \Delta p}{8\eta l}\right)  =  \frac{3 ml}{10 s\times 0.3^{4} mm^{4}}  = \frac{3 ml}{8 s\times R^{4}}  
      </me>
      <me>
        \text{or,}\quad R^{4} = \frac{10\times 0.3^{4}}{8}
      </me>
      <me>
        \therefore\quad R = 0.32 \,mm

  <statement>
    <p>
      A 3 mm diameter glass ball (<m>\rho=2500 \,kg/m^{3}</m>) is dropped into a fluid 
      whose density is <m>875 \,kg/m^{3},</m> and the terminal velocity of the ball 
      is measured to be  0.16 m/s.  Determine the viscosity of the fluid.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      Given: <m>r =  1.5\,mm = 0.0015\,m, \quad \rho=2500 \,kg/m^{3}, \quad \sigma=875 kg/m^{3},</m> and <m>v = 0.16 m/s.</m> 
      The viscous force in a fluid is given by
      <me>
        F=6\pi \eta r v
      </me>
            But ball experiences buoyant force and viscous force while falling into a liquid. 
            After achieving the terminal velocity, we have - 
            <me>
              F+B=mg
            </me>
            <me>
              \text{or,}\quad 6\pi \eta r v + V\sigma g = V\rho g
            </me>
               where <m>\sigma</m> is a density of the fluid. Hence on solving the above equation, we get -
               <me>
                \eta = \frac{2 r^{2}(\rho-\sigma) g}{9 v} 
               </me>
               [<xref ref="subsubsec-terminal_vel"/>]
              <me>
                \therefore \quad \eta = \frac{2 (0.0015)^{2}(2500-875) 9.8}{9 \times 0.16} = 0.049 \,Ns/m^{2}
              </me>

  <statement>
    <p>
      A 5 cm long needle is floating on the surface water without wetting. 
      Find its weight, if surface tension <m>\gamma =0.07 \,N/m.</m>
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <image source="surften2.png" width ="35%"> </image>
    <p>
      If <m>W</m> is the weight of the needle, then 
      <me>
        W = 2F\cos\theta
      </me>
      <me>
        \text{or,}\quad W = 2\gamma l \cos\theta 
      </me>
      <m>[\because F = \gamma l]</m>
      <me>
        \text{or,}\quad W = 2\times 0.07 \,(N/m)\times (0.05 \,m)\times 1 
      </me>
    for a needle floating without wetting, <m>\theta=0.</m> 
    <me>
      \therefore \quad W = 0.007 \,N

<example>
  <statement>
    <p>
      A thin ring of radius 3 cm  is rested flat on the liquid surface. 
      When the ring is raised 0.03 N of force difference is noted  before and after 
      the film breaks. What is the surface tension of the liquid?
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <image source="surfring.png" width ="35%"> </image>
    <p>
      When the ring is lifted gently form the surface of a liquid it forms a thin 
      film around the ring. The film shrinks in it due to cohesive force as the 
      ring pulled up and eventually the contact angle becomes zero just before it breaks. 
      Hence in that case, 
      <me>
        F_{1} = F_{t}+W 
      </me>
      with film adheres to ring,
       and 
       <me>
        F_{2} = W
       </me>
       when film breaks.
       <me>
        \therefore\quad F_{1} - F_{2} = F = F_{t}+W -W
       </me>
       where <m>F_{t}</m> is a force due to surface tension of the film. 
       <me>
        \text{or,}\quad 0.03 N = 2\gamma l 
       </me>
        The factor 2 is taken because of two surfaces of the film both inside and outside of the ring.
        <me>
          \text{or,} \quad 0.03 N = 2\gamma (2\pi r)
        </me>
        <me>
          \therefore\quad \gamma = \frac{0.03 \,N}{4\pi\times 0.03 \,m}  = 0.08 \,N/m

      A rectangle wire frame has a length of 4 cm and breadth of 3 cm. 
      What force does the  side experience due to surface tension of the

        \gamma = \frac{F\Delta x}{\Delta A} = \frac{F\Delta x}{l_{eff}\Delta x}= \frac{F}{l_{eff}}
      </me>
      where, <m>l_{eff} = 2 \times 2(l+b)</m> as liquid film has two surfaces around perimeter of the frame. 
      <me>
        \therefore\quad F = \gamma l_{eff} = (0.03 \,N/m)\times 4 \times (0.04 +0.03) \,m = 0.0084 \,N = 8.4\times10^{-3} \,N
