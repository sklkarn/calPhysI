  <title>Gravitation</title>
    
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Gravitation is a fundamental force of nature that governs the attraction between 
      objects with mass. It is one of the four fundamental forces in the universe, 
      alongside electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force. 
      Gravitation is responsible for many aspects of the motion and behavior of celestial bodies, 
      from the way planets orbit the Sun to the way galaxies interact with each other. 
      It is a universal force that acts on all objects with mass, regardless of their 
      size or distance from each other. It is not limited to just the Earth but extends 
      throughout the entire universe.

      <p>
        Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, developed in the early <m>20^{th} </m>century, 
        expanded our understanding of gravitation. It describes gravitation as the curvature of 
        spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy. This theory has been confirmed 
        through various experiments and observations.
