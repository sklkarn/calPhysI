 <title>Thermal Expansion</title>
 
 <introduction>
 <p>
  You may have observed that Jammed lid of a bottle can be easily unscrewed 
  if it is put into the hot water for sometime. A partially inflated balloon 
  expands to full size when placed in lukewarm water. A fully inflated balloon begins 
  shrinking when immersed in cold water. Most materials expand on heating and contract 
  on cooling. The physical property of a material due to which a body can change its 
  dimensions with a change in temperature is called a <term>thermal expansion</term>. 
  The expansion in length is called <em>linear expansion</em>, the expansion in area is called 
  <em>superficial expansion</em>, and the expansion in volume is called <em>volumetric expansion.</em> or bulk expansion.

  <title>Linear Expansion</title>
  <p>
    Suppose a rod of original length <m>l_{o}</m> is heated for a temperature difference of 
    <m>\Delta T</m>, then we can find that the change in its length is proportional to the change in temperature, i.e.,
    <me>\Delta l  \,\propto \,\Delta T </me>. 
    If  <m>\Delta T </m> increases <m>\Delta l </m> also increases by itself.  
    We can also see that the change in length is also proportional to its original length [<xref ref="lexpns"/>], i.e.,
    <me>
      \Delta l  \propto l_{o}
    </me>
    Hence by combining these properties, we can have 
        <me>
          \Delta l  \propto l_{o}\times \Delta T
        </me>
        <me>
          \text{or,}\quad \Delta l  =\alpha l_{o}\times \Delta T
        </me>
            where <m>\alpha</m> is a proportionality constant called coefficient of linear expansion 
            or linear expansivity. It is a material property. This distinguishes the expansion properties 
            of one material to another.
            <me>
              \text{or,}\qquad \alpha =\frac{\Delta l }{l_{o}\Delta T}= \frac{l-l_{o}}{l_{o}\left(T-T_{o}\right)}
            </me>
            <me>
              \therefore \quad l= l_{o}\left(1+\alpha\Delta T\right)
            </me>
            Hence, linear expansivity is defined as the change in length of a rod per unit original length per unit rise of temperature.

  <title>Superficial Expansion</title>
  <p>
    If a thin plate of original area <m>A_{o}</m> [<xref ref="aexpns"/>] is heated for a temperature difference of 
    <m>\Delta T</m>, then we can find that the change in its area 
    <me>
      \Delta A  \propto A_{o}\times \Delta T
    </me>
    <me>
      \text{or,}\quad \Delta A  =\beta A_{o}\times \Delta T
    </me>
      where <m> \beta</m> is a proportionality constant called coefficient of superficial 
      expansion or superficial expansivity. It is a material property.  
      <me>
        \text{or,}\qquad \beta =\frac{A-A_{o}}{A_{o}\left(T-T_{o}\right)}
      </me>
      <me>
        \therefore \quad A= A_{o}\left(1+\beta\Delta T\right)
      </me>
      Hence, superficial expansivity is defined as the change in area of a plate per unit original area per unit rise of temperature.

  <title>Volumetric (Cubic) Expansion</title>

    If a cuboid of original volume <m>V_{o}</m>  [<xref ref="vexpns"/>] 
    is heated for a temperature difference of <m>\Delta T</m>, then we can find that the change in its volume,
      <me>
        \Delta V  \propto V_{o}\times \Delta T
      </me>
      <me>
        \text{or,}\quad \Delta V  =\gamma V_{o}\times \Delta T
      </me>
      where <m>\gamma </m> is a proportionality constant called coefficient of volumetric 
      expansion or volumetric expansivity. It is a material property. 
      <me>
        \text{or,}\qquad \gamma =\frac{V-V_{o}}{V_{o}\left(T-T_{o}\right)}
      </me>
      <me>
        \therefore \quad V= V_{o}\left(1+\gamma\Delta T\right)
      </me>
      Most materials expand on heating and possess positive coefficient of expansion,  
      e.g., metals, glass, etc. However, some materials contract on heating and possess 
      negative coefficient of expansion, e.g., water, bismuth, welding rods, etc.

    Consider a solid cube of side <m>l_{o}</m> at temperature <m>T_{o}</m> and  
    <m>l</m> at temperature <m>T.</m>  Hence from linear expansion, we have 
    <me>
      l=l_{o}\left[1+\alpha \left(T-T_{o}\right)\right]

    The volume of a cube is therefore, 
    <me>

      = V_{o}\left[1+3\alpha \Delta T+3\alpha^{2}\Delta T^{2}+\alpha^{3}\Delta T^{3})\right]

    Now since <m>\alpha </m> is very small, <m>\alpha^{2}</m> is very very small. 
    Hence the quantities <m>\alpha^{2}\Delta T^{2}</m> and <m>\alpha^{3}\Delta T^{3}</m> are neglected.

        Similarly the area of a cube is given by -

<subsection xml:id="subsec-water_anom">
  <title>Anomalous expansion of water</title>
 <p>
  Normally, substances expand on heating and contract on cooling. 
  Water exists in three phases solid, liquid, and gas. At temperatures below <m>0^{o}C,</m> 
  water exists as a solid ice, occupying a bigger volume. When heated, it expands 
  like normal solid up to <m>0^{o}C.</m> It begins melting at <m>0^{o}C</m> to 
  liquid water without any change in temperature. Melting is accompanied by a 
  decrease in its volume by about <m>8\%</m>. As temperature increases above <m>0^{o}C,</m> 
  water contracts further up to <m>4^{o}C</m> and occupies the minimum volume at <m>4^{o}C</m>. 
  Therefore water has maximum density at <m>4^{o}C</m> which is about <m>1 \,g/cm^{3}.</m> 
  Above <m>4^{o}C</m>, water expands like any other liquid. This behavior of water is 
  described as anomalous, unusual, irregular, or peculiar behavior of water. The importance of 
  anomalous properties of water can be summarized as:  
  <ol marker="i.">
    <li>
      During cold weather, the temperature of lakes drops and water contracts, becomes denser and sinks.
      A circulation of water is thus set up until all the water attain maximum density i.e. at <m>4^{o}C</m>. 
      If further cooling occurs (below <m>4^{o}C</m>), then any water below <m>4^{o}C</m> will 
      stay at the top due to its lower density.  At <m>0^{o}C,</m> ice forms on top and this acts 
      as an insulator to the layers below. Hence the relatively warm water underneath ice layer can help sustain aquatic life.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ice has a slightly lower density than that of water and hence it floats with a small portion above the water surface. 
      The rest and a larger portion of the ice rests under water. This is called an iceberg. Icebergs pose a great danger to 
      ships as the submerged parts cannot be seen easily by navigators.
