 <title>Kinetic Theory of Ideal Gas</title>
 <introduction>
  <p>
    Kinetic theory of matter is developed to explain the nature of heat and the motion of 
    particles associated with heat energy. According to this theory, every substance is composed of 
    large number of very tiny particles called <term>molecules</term>. These molecules are always 
    in random motion with all possible velocities which increases with the increase of temperature. 
    On this basis, in solids, molecules are very closely packed and attract each other with a 
    large cohesive force. They cannot move freely but can vibrate about their mean positions. 
    This explains the definite size and shape of solids. In liquids, the molecules are farther 
    apart than in solids and attract each other with a comparatively  smaller cohesive force. 
    This force does not allow them to escape the liquids however, they can move freely anywhere 
    within the liquids. This explains why a liquid has a definite size (volume) but no shape  
    of its own. In gases, the molecules are very far away from each other than in solids and 
    liquids and have negligibly small force of attraction between them. Hence they can move 
    freely anywhere within the available space. This explains why a gas has no definite shape and size.
  </p>
  <p>
    To understand the more general behavior of gases <em>kinetic theory of ideal gases</em> is postulated as 
    <ol marker="i.">
      <li>
        All gases are made up of molecules. Molecules are identical, rigid, and perfectly elastic moving in 
        random directions with all possible velocities.
      </li>
      <li>
        The molecules are very far away from each other but they collide with each other and with walls of the container. 
      </li>
      <li>
        All the collision are elastic, but time spent during each collision is negligibly small compared to the time spent between the collisions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Molecules do not interact with each other (no intermolecular force of attraction)  except during  a collision.
      </li>
      <li>
        The average kinetic energy of the molecules of any gas depends only on the temperature.
      </li>
    </ol>
        The distance between the collision is called the <em>free path</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ideal gas is a hypothetical gas of negligible molecular size and have no interactions 
    among their molecules. The above postulates are the correct description of ideal gas. 
    In practice, a very dilute gas with extremely large volume of container space can be 
    considered as an ideal gas. Remember the real gas molecules has definite size and may 
    interact with each other. Hence this postulates are just a very simplified model 
    to understand gas laws and need modification for real gas behaviors.

  <title>Pressure of an Ideal Gas</title>
  <p>
    When the molecules of a gas collide on the walls of the container (or each other) they exert a pressure. 
    Let us consider a cube of sides <m>l</m> cm encloses  <m>N</m> number of molecules and 
    mass of each molecule is <m>m</m>. Since time during the collision of molecules is so 
    small there is no transfer of momentum hence no exertion of force (Newton's II law) 
    or no pressure, we ignore therefore the collision of  molecules amongst themselves here. 
    Let a molecule at point <m>p</m> is moving with velocity <m>\vec{v}</m> in any direction. 
    This velocity can be resolved into x,y, and z directions as <m>v_{x}, \quad v_{y}, </m> 
    and <m>v_{z},</m> respectively, such that 
    <men xml:id="eqn-gaspres1">

    <p>
    Let a molecule collide elastically on the face BCDG along x-axis [<xref ref="idealgas1"/>]. 
    The momentum of the molecule along x-axis before collision is <m>mv_{x}.</m> 
    Since the collision is elastic the molecule rebound with the same velocity along 
    opposite to x-axis. Therefore the momentum in this case will be  <m>-mv_{x}.</m> 
    The change in momentum of the molecule due to this collision along x-axis will be 
    <me>
      \Delta p = mv_{x} -(-mv_{x})= 2mv_{x}.
    </me>
    Now once this molecule collide to the face EFAO while moving along -ve axis and 
    rebounds it again comes to collide with the same face BCDG. The distance traveled 
    by the molecule for collision on the same face is <m> 2l.</m> Hence, the time 
    taken between each successive collision on face BCDG is given by 
    <me>
      \Delta t=\frac{d}{v}=\frac{2l}{v_{x}}
    </me>
    Therefore, the force exerted on the face BCDG by  molecule <m>l</m> is given by 
    Newton's II law of motion,  
    <me>
      f_{x_{1}}=\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} = \frac{(2mv_{x_{1}})v_{x_{1}}}{2l}=\frac{mv^{2}_{x_{1}}}{l}
    </me>
    Since there are <m>N</m> molecules hence total force exerted on the face BCDG is given by 
    <me>
      f_{x} = f_{x_{1}} +f_{x_{2}}+f_{x_{3}}+\cdots 
    </me>
    <me>
      = \frac{m}{l}\left(v^{2}_{x_{1}}+ v^{2}_{x_{2}}+v^{2}_{x_{3}}+\cdots +v^{2}_{x_{N}}\right)
    </me>
    The pressure on the face BCDG will be 	
    <me>
      p_{x} = \frac{F}{A}
    </me>
    <me>
      = \frac{f_{x}}{l^{2}}=\frac{m}{l^{3}}\left[\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N}v^{2}_{x_{i}}\right] 
    </me>
     Similarly, pressures <m>p_{y},</m> and <m>p_{z}</m> along the y- and z- axes, respectively are  
     <me>
      p_{y} =\frac{m}{l^{3}}\left[\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N}v^{2}_{y_{i}}\right]

     and
     <me>
      p_{z} =\frac{m}{l^{3}}\left[\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N}v^{2}_{z_{i}}\right] 
     </me>
     Hence, the average pressure in the container

     </me>
     <me>
      =\frac{m}{3l^{3}}\left[\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N}\left(v^{2}_{x_{i}}+v^{2}_{y_{i}}+v^{2}_{z_{i}}\right)\right]

      p=\frac{m}{3l^{3}}\left[\left(v^{2}_{x_{1}}+v^{2}_{y_{1}}+v^{2}_{z_{1}}\right)+\left(v^{2}_{x_{2}}+v^{2}_{y_{2}}+v^{2}_{z_{2}}\right)+\cdots+ \left(v^{2}_{x_{N}}+v^{2}_{y_{N}}+v^{2}_{z_{N}}\right)\right]
     </me>
     <me>
      p=\frac{m}{3l^{3}}\left[v^{2}_{1}+v^{2}_{2}+\cdots+v^{2}_{N}\right] =\frac{m}{3V}N\overline{v^{2}}

<me>
  \therefore\quad p=\frac{2}{3}\frac{KE}{V}

That is, pressure is two-thirds of the total transational kinetic energy of the molecules per unit volume.
Now from postulates average kinetic energy of the molecules of the gas depends only on temperature, we have

    The degree of freedom is the number of independent motions possible to a particle 
    or the number of independent coordinates required to specify particle's dynamic 
    position or the number of independent ways of exchanging particle's energy. 
    It depends on the atomic arrangement of an ideal gas molecule and types of motion 
    it could have in the container. For example, it could have the combination of 
    translation,  rotational, and vibrational motion. For a monoatomic gas molecules 
    (like helium, argon),  consists of a single atom and can be represented by a point 
    in space [<xref ref="dfreedom1"/>]. Such molecule therefore can have only translational motion 
    in any of x-,y-,and z- direction. Thus it can have three independent motion and 
    hence three degrees of freedom.   <idx><h>degree of freedom</h></idx>
  </p>
  <p>
    The molecule of a diatomic gas (like hydrogen, oxygen) is made up of two atoms joined 
    rigidly like a dumbbell [<xref ref="dfreedom2"/>]. Such a molecule can translate 
    as well as rotate about any one of the three mutually perpendicular axes. 
    However, rotational inertia about an axis along the rigid rod will be negligible 
    as compared to the other two rotational axes. Hence it can have only two rotational 
    motions and three translational motions. The degrees of freedom for diatomic molecule 
    is therefore five. A triatomic molecule  either have linear arrangement of atoms 
    (like <m>CO_{2}, \quad O=C=O</m>) or tringular arrangement (like <m>H_{2}O</m>), 
    hence it may have either 7 (3 rotational, 1 vibrational, and 3 translational  motions) 
    degrees of freedom or 6 (3 rotational, and 3 translational motions)  [<xref ref="dfreedom3"/>]. 
    If we consider each molecule has three translational motions <m>N</m>, and the atoms 
    are constrained to move along the rigid support, <m>d</m> then degrees of freedom, <m>f=N-d</m>. 
    Hence for monoatomic gas, <m>f=3-0=3;</m>  for diatomic gas, <m>f=6-1=5;</m> and

  <title>Internal Energy of a Gas</title>
  <p>
    A liquid freezes into solid gives heat energy, Zinc reacts with copper sulfate 
    in a voltaic cell produces electric energy. A mixture of hydrogen and oxygen explodes 
    to release mechanical energy. This production of energy is actually a conversion of 
    stored energy of a system. The apparently stored  energy of a system is called an <em>internal energy</em>. 
    Real gas molecules posses both kinetic energy (due to motion of the molecules) 
    and potential energy (due to intermolecular force of attraction) and hence the 
    internal energy of the real gas is the sum of all of its internal kinetic and 
    internal potential energy of the molecules. Ideal gas molecules are very 
    far away from each other hence they do not have internal potential energy. 
    The internal energy of an ideal is therefore solely due to the internal kinetic 
    energy of all of its gas molecules and it is denoted by <m>U.</m> 
    Therefore the internal energy of one molecule of a gas, 
    <me>
      \frac{1}{2}mv_{rms}^{2}= \frac{3}{2}k_{B}T

    Hence, for N molecules of a gas, the internal energy is given by

     At constant temperature, the average force of each particle striking the surface

   This is called a pressure law (or Gay-Lussac's law), the <m>V \sim T</m> diagram is 
   shown in <xref ref="pressurelaw"/>. As the temperature increases, the average kinetic energy 
   increases as does the velocity of the gas particles hitting the walls of the container. 
   The force exerted by the particles per unit of area on the container is the pressure, 
   so as the temperature increases the pressure must also increase. 
   <term>Pressure is proportional to temperature</term>, if the number of particles and 
   the volume of the container are constant.

    <term>Avogadro's law:</term> Volume of a gas is directly proportional to the amount 
    of gas at a constant temperature and pressure, i.e.,  
    <me>
      V\propto n.
    </me>
    <term> The Combined Gas Law: </term> If number moles of a gas only remains constant, 
    then we have - 
    <me>
      \frac{pV}{T}=constant. 
    </me>
    The volume of a given amount of gas is  proportional to the ratio of its 
    absolute temperature and its pressure, i.e., 
    <me>
      V\propto\frac{T}{p}.
