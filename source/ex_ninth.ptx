      An aluminum weight of mass 200 g is attached by a short string to the bottom of a 
      float of density <m>0.3 g/cm^{3}</m> which is supported by another string attached 
      to a mass balance. When both the weight and the float are completely immersed in water 
      the balance reads  50 g. What is 
      <ol marker="a.">

        <li>
          the buoyant force of the water on the aluminum weight.
        </li>
        <li>
          What would the balance read if only the weight were under water?

      The weight density of fresh water is <m>62.4 \,lb/ft^{3}</m> and the specific gravity of 
      ice is 0.917. What is the minimum size (in feet) of a square slab of ice 1 ft 
      thick that would support a man weighing 180 lbs?

      A hang glider has a wing area of <m>165 \,ft^{2},</m> weighs 70 lb (pounds), 
      and caries a pilot weighing 200 lb with his equipment. If the velocity of 
      the air under the wing is half that over the top, what is the average airspeed 
      of the glider in miles per hour? Hint: This problem can be worked in the FPS 
      system by using the fact that the specific gravity of air is <m>1.29 \times 10^{-3}</m> 
      and the weight density of water is <m>62.4 \,lb/ft^{3}</m>.
