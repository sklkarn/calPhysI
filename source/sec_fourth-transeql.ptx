  <title>Translational Equilibrium</title>
  
   <introduction>
    <p>
      An object is in translational equilibrium if the vector sum of the forces acting on that object add to zero.

           An object in translational equilibrium continues moving in a straight line with a constant speed as 
           described by Newton's First law. That is <me>\sum\vec{F}  =  0</me> (Graphical and vector algebra problems.) 
           or equivalently  <me>\sum\vec{F}_{x}  =  0</me> (x-component of net force), <me>\sum\vec{F}_{y}  =  0</me> 
           (y-component of net force), <me>w  =  m g </me> (weight equation), and <me>f = \mu N</me>	(friction equation). 
           In translational motion <m>v\neq 0, a = 0,</m> and <m>F= 0</m>.

            Problem Solving Technique: To solve a translational equilibrium problem one needs to:

              <li>
                Read problem, list given quantities, and label a drawing of the physical situation.	
              </li>
              <li>Draw force diagrams for each body in translational equilibrium.</li>
              <li>Resolve the forces into components.	</li>
              <li>Sum the x- and y-components of forces and set them to zero.</li>
              <li>Include a weight equation for each mass.</li>
              <li>Include a friction equation for each surface.</li>
              <li>Solve equations simultaneously for the quantities of interest.</li>
