    A paper clip, a needle, small insects, etc. can float on the surface of water 
    without getting wet [<xref ref="surften1"/>]. If these events have been observed very closely 
    we can find that water surface behaves as if it is  a thin stretched membrane of some kind. 
    The strength of such membrane arises due to intermolecular attraction of the liquid. 
    Liquid molecules try to get as closer as they can. The minimum average distance between 
    the molecules of a liquid occurs when the liquid acquires a spherical shape. A spherical 
    surface possess minimum surface area. Hence a property of a liquid by virtue of which 
    it acquires minimum surface area is called a <term>surface tension</term>. 
    The cohesive nature of a liquid helps resist an external force.  If a force <m>F</m> is 
    acting on a length <m>l</m> by the liquid surface to balance an external force then, 
    it can be seen that 
    <me>
      F\propto l 
    </me>
    <me>
      \Rightarrow\quad F = \gamma l
    </me>
        Where <m> \gamma </m> is a proportionality constant known as <em>coefficient of surface tension</em>, 
        and is a property of the material of the liquid. The force is parallel to the surface and 
        perpendicular to the line. The SI unit of surface tension is N/m. Suppose a needle of length 
        <m>l</m> is placed of the surface of water very gently, so that it can float. 
        If <m>\gamma</m> be the surface tension of water then the needle of maximum weight, 
        <m>W</m> that can be placed on the water surface will be given by - 
<me>
  \sum F = 0
</me>
<me>
  \text{or,}\quad F_{1} \cos\theta + F_{2} \cos\theta - W =0
</me>
<me>
  \text{or,}\quad \gamma l \cos\theta + \gamma l \cos\theta -W =0
</me>
<me>
  \text{or,} \quad W = 2\gamma l cos\theta 
</me>
For maximum weight,
<me>
  \theta = 0, \qquad \therefore W = 2\gamma l 
</me>
When needle is placed on the water surface, it depresses the water surface which 
applies forces <m>F_{1}</m> and <m>F_{2}</m> on the needle acting along its 
length on either side so that the needle can be balanced [<xref ref="surften2"/>].

      Surface tension arises due to strong intermolecular forces of attraction between 
      the molecules. When those forces act between like molecules, they are referred 
      to as <term>cohesive forces</term>. Cohesion is a tendency of the liquid to remain 
      as one assembly of particles. Surface tension is due to cohesion between particles 
      at the free surface.  A liquid, however, is often in contact with a solid surface, 
      such as glass. Hence the additional forces of attraction occur between molecules of 
      the liquid and molecules of the solid surface. When the attractive forces act between 
      unlike molecules, they are said to be <term>adhesive forces</term>. 
      This property enables a liquid to stick to another body. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Capillary is a phenomenon  by which a liquid rises up into a narrow tube (called <em>capillary</em>) 
        above or below its general level. The upper surface of a liquid in a tube is called the <em>meniscus</em>, 
        and the shape of the meniscus depends on the relative strengths of the cohesive and adhesive forces. 
        In liquids such as water, the meniscus is concave, because of high adhesive forces between water 
        and glass molecules. In liquids such as mercury, the meniscus is convex because the molecules of 
        mercury have very strong cohesive forces and weak adhesion to glass. 
        The height to which the water rises depends on the diameter of the tube and the temperature 
        of the water  but not on the angle of tilt of the tube in water. The smaller the diameter, 
        the higher the liquid rises.

      Capillary action provides wetting ability of liquids on the solid interfaces. 
      The contact angle <m>\theta</m> between the liquid boundary and the solid surface is 
      a measure of the degree of wetting. Adhesion and surface tension together can produce 
      capillary action. Capillary action occurs when the adhesion to the walls is stronger 
      than the cohesive forces between the liquid molecules.  Adhesion of water to the walls 
      of a vessel results in an upward force on the liquid at the edges. 
      The water keep rising in the capillary till the weight of this portion of water 
      is balanced by the vertical component of such upward force. 
      From <xref ref="capilary3"/>, we have - 
      <me>
        mg=F\cos\theta 
      </me>
      <me>
        \text{or,}\quad V\rho g = \gamma l \cos\theta  
      </me>
      <m>[\because F=\gamma l, \quad m=V\rho]</m>
        <me>
          \text{or,}\quad (\pi r^{2}h)\rho g = \gamma (2\pi r) \cos\theta 
        </me>
        <m>[\because V=area\times height, \quad l=2\pi r]</m>
        Here <m>\rho</m> is density of liquid like water, <m>r</m> is radius of capillary, 
        and <m>\theta</m> is angle of contact. 
        <me>
          \therefore \quad h = \frac{2\gamma\cos\theta}{\rho r g}  
        </me>
        A smaller contact angle and a smaller surface tension result in a greater the 
        degree of wetting. When adhesive forces are greater than cohesive forces, 
        the contact angle <m>\theta</m>  lies between 0 and <m>90^{o}.</m> 
        When adhesive forces are smaller than cohesive forces, the contact angle <m> \theta</m>  
        lies between <m>90^{o}</m> and <m>180^{o}</m> [<xref ref="capilary4"/> and <xref ref="capilary5"/>]. 
        When water is dripping from the narrow orifice its shape is a little bit oval because of 
        gravity. However, the shape would be completely spherical in absence of gravity because 
        of surface tension of the water.

    <title>Equivalence between surface tension and surface energy</title>

    <p>
      The natural tendency of a liquid is to contract its surface area to minimum its size. 
      Therefore, work is required to increase the surface area of a liquid film. 
      Increasing the surface area increasing the energy of the film. Hence, surface tension 
      is the energy (or work) required to increase the surface area of a liquid by unit. 
      Consider a thin film of liquid, ABCD, contained in a rectangular wire frame of 
      movable side CD, as shown in <xref ref="surffilm"/>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now consider that the film is stretched by moving the side CD of the frame by <m>\Delta x</m> 
      to the new position PQ. If <m>\gamma</m>  is the surface tension of the liquid and a 
      force <m>F</m> is applied, then work done by the force to stretch the film, 
      <me>
        W = F\Delta x = 2 \gamma l \Delta x
      </me>
      The factor 2 is taken because of two open surface area of the film on both sides of wire mesh. 
      If <m>\Delta A = 2 l \Delta x </m> be the increased surface area of the film, then 
      <me>
        W =  \gamma  \Delta A
      </me>
     </p>
     <p>
<me>
  \therefore\quad \gamma = \frac{W}{\Delta A}
</me>
Therefore, surface tension can also be defined in terms of energy, it is the ratio of change 
in surface energy to the change in surface area of the film. The surface tension is greatly 
dependent on temperature, so the definition of surface tension in terms of work per unit area 
is very useful in thermodynamics. The SI unit, in that case, is <m>J/m^{2}.</m>

   <subsection xml:id="subsec-buble">
    <title>Soap Bubble</title>
    <figure xml:id="soapbubble">
      <caption></caption>
      <image source="soapbubble.png" width="30%"/>
  </figure>
    <p>
      When the bubble is blown, the surface film tends to contract. This causes pressure inside 
      the bubble to increase. The surface tension balances the outward force due to the 
      pressure difference between the inside and the outside air. For the bubble to be 
      stable and not collapse, the pressure inside the bubble must be higher than the pressure 
      on the outside. In fact, there are two liquid-gas interfaces on a soap bubble, 
      the one on the inside of the bubble and the one on the outside of the bubble <xref ref="soapbubble"/>. 
      In between the two surfaces is a thin film of liquid. The spherical shape of a 
      soap bubble is caused by the minimization of the surface area.  For a given volume, 
      a sphere always acquires the least surface area.
    </p>
    <p>
      The force from surface tension is <m>F = 2\gamma l,</m> where the factor 2 
      is taken because of two surfaces of the soap bubble. 
      <me>
        \therefore F = 2\gamma 2\pi r = 4\gamma \pi r
      </me>
      The force do to the pressure difference must balance the force from the 
      surface tension. The force to the pressure difference is 
      <me>
        F = pA= (p_{i} - p_{o})(\pi r^{2})
      </me>
      <me>
        \text{or,}\quad 4\gamma \pi r = (p_{i} - p_{o})(\pi r^{2})
      </me>
      <me>
        \therefore\quad   (\Delta p) = \frac{4\gamma}{r}
      </me>
