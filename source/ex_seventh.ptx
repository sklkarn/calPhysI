      A uniform cylinder of mass 100 kg has a radius of 30 cm  and spins freely about its 
      axis of symmetry. One end of a string is attached to the surface of the cylinder 
      so that the string winds and unwinds as the cylinder rotates first one direction 
      and then the other. A constant tension of 100 N  is maintained in the string by 
      a constant vector force applied to the other end of the string. At time t = 0, 
      the string is completely unwound and the cylinder is spinning at 30 rad/s.
