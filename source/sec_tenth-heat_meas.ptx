 <title>Quantity of Heat</title>
 
 <introduction>
  <p>
    Heat is a transfer of energy. When an object gains or losses heat it either 
    changes its temperature or its phase. A change in temperature is associated 
    with changes in the average kinetic energy of the particles and a change in phase 
    is associated with changes in the internal potential energy possessed by the object. 
    In this section we will learn how to measure the quantity of heat gained or released by an object.

 <subsection xml:id="subsec-sp_heat">
  <title>Specific Heat Capacity</title>
  <p>
    Heat absorbing capacity of a material is known as specific heat capacity. 
    Suppose we have two marbles at room temperature <m>T_{o}=25^{o}C</m>, one has 
    mass 1 kg  and another has mass 2 kg. If we want to heat them to <m>100^{o}C</m>, 
    then from our experience we know that 2 kg marble will take longer than 1 kg marble 
    to reach at the same temperature. Hence, the amount of heat (Q) put into the 
    material is directly proportional to the mass (m) of the material. That is,
    <me>
      Q \propto m
    </me>
    Now suppose both of our marbles has a mass of 1 kg each and we want to heat one of them for 
    <m>T_{1}= 100^{o}C</m> and another for temperature <m>T_{2}= 200^{o}C.</m> We can again 
    tell that the marble which has to be heated for <m>200^{o}C</m>  will take longer than the other. That is, 
    <me>
      Q \propto \Delta T 
    </me>
    where <m>\Delta T = T_{f}-T_{o}</m>. For marble of mass 1 kg, <m>\Delta T = 100-25 =75^{o}C</m> 
    and for the marble of mass 2 kg <m>\Delta T = 200-25 =175^{o}C.</m>  
    By combining these two expressions, we have - 
    <me>
      Q\propto m\Delta T
    </me>
    <me>
      \therefore\quad Q = mc\Delta T
    </me>
    where <m>c</m> is a proportionality constant and is called specific heat capacity of the material. 
    It is the properties of a material. Different materials have different specific heat 
    capacities and hence they absorb or release heat differently. 
    <me>
      c=\frac{Q}{m\Delta T} 
    </me>
    If m=1 kg, <m>\Delta T= 1^{o}C</m>, then <m>c=Q</m>, i.e., specific heat capacity of a 
    material is the amount of heat added into or taken out from the material of unit mass 
    to the unit degree rise or fall of temperature. In SI system, unit of <m>c</m> is <m>J/kg/^{o}C</m>. 
    In heat and thermodynamics, we normally measure heat in <em>calorie</em> unit but other physical 
    quantities in <em>SI unit</em>. Hence the mixture of systems of unit can be seen in this chapter. 
    In cgs system, unit of specific heat capacity of water is <m>1\,cal/g/^{o}C.</m>  <fn><m>1 \,cal = 4.186 \,J.</m></fn> 
    The capacity of a material to absorb heat per degree rise of temperature is called <term>heat capacity</term>. 
    It is defined as <m>C=mc</m>. The amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one mole 
    of a substance by one degree (Celsius or Kelvin) is known as  <term>molar (specific) heat capacity</term>.
   </p>
 </subsection>
 
 <subsection xml:id="subsec-latent">
  <title>Latent Heat</title>
  <p>
    Heat absorbed or released by the material during phase change is called latent heat. 
    There is no temperature change during a phase change hence this energy is hidden 
    from temperature scale. The energy dissipated or released during phase change is 
    in adjustment of particles potential energy in the bonds. Hence the amount of heat <m>Q</m> 
    during phase change is proportional to the mass of a material. That is,
    <me>
      Q\propto m
    </me>
    <me>
      \therefore\quad  Q  =  m  L
    </me>
        where <m>L</m> is a latent heat during phase change. It is also a material property. 
        The latent (hidden) heat of fusion for water at <m>0^{o}C</m> is approximately <m>334 \,joules/g</m> 
        (79.7 calories/g), and the latent heat of vaporization at <m>100^{o}C</m> is about 2,230 joules per gram (or, 533 calories per gram) .

  <title>Phase Changes of Matter</title>
  <p>
    We know that ice is solid water, even steam is water as well. Any material can exist 
    in three different states solid, liquid, and gas are also known as the phases of matter. 
    When ice is heated it melts into liquid water and then evaporates into water vapor. 
    These changes from one phase to another are referred to as <term>phase changes</term>.

</figure>
<p>
  We may also have noticed that the temperature of water doesn't change during boiling. 
  The temperature of water increases up to boiling and then remains constant as it boils. 
  The following diagram illustrates the relationship between temperature and amount of heat 
  needed to change the phases of water. We can see that the temperature increases as heat is 
  added to water within a phase. Adding heat into the water increases the kinetic energy of 
  water molecules within the ice. During the phase change, the added heat doesn't make the 
  molecules move faster, but make them further apart. The heat energy added during the phase 
  change is consumed to overcome intermolecular force of attraction and stored within 
  the material in the form of potential energy of the molecules. Where amount of heat 
  added to the system can be obtained by <m>Q_{1}= (mc\Delta T)_{ice},</m> 
  <m>Q_{2}= (mL_{f})_{ice\to water}, </m> <m>Q_{3}= (mc\Delta T)_{water},</m> 
  <m>Q_{4}= (mL_{v})_{water\to vapor},</m> and <m> Q_{5}= (mc\Delta T)_{vapor}.</m>
</p>
<p>
  While cooling process heat is taken out from the system, then latent heat of vaporization 
  becomes latent heat of condensation and latent heat of melting becomes latent heat of fusion. 
  For water, latent heat of melting and latent heat of fusion are same. Similarly, 
  latent heat of vaporization and latent heat of condensation are same but they are not 
  same for many other materials.  Phase of matter changes from solid to liquid is called 
  melting or <em>fusion</em>,  from solid to gas is called <em>sublimation</em>, from liquid to solid is called 
  <em>freezing</em>, from liquid to gas is called <em>evaporation</em> or boiling, from gas to solid is called 
  <em>deposition</em>, from gas to liquid is called <em>condensation</em>, from plasma state to gaseous state is 
  called <em>recombination</em>, and from gaseous state to plasma state is called <em>ionization</em>.

    It is a process to measure amounts of heat (calories) transferred to or from a substance. 
    A  device used to measure the amount of heat involved in the process is called a <term>calorimeter</term>. 
    A basic calorimeter consists of a metal container of water, in which a thermometer is 
    used to measure the change in water temperature and a stirrer to stir water frequently 
    to maintain uniform temperature.  The principle of calorimetry states that in an 
    isolated system heat lost by one component of calorimeter is equal to heat gained 
    by the another components of the calorimeter. A <em>calorie</em> is the amount of energy 
    required to raise one gram of water by one degree Celsius. From the principle of calorimetry, 
    <me>
      \sum Q = 0

    i.e., heat loss = heat gain.

    It is a point in the phase diagram at which the solid, liquid, and vapor 
    can co-exist. Phase diagram is characteristic curves of the material between pressure, 
    volume, and temperature. Figure 10.8 is a PT curve shown as a phase diagram of water at constant volume. 
    The of temperature at which the solid and liquid states are in equilibrium is called 
    <em>melting point</em> and the line at which they co-exist is called the <em>ice line</em>. 
    The temperatures at which the solid and gaseous states are in equilibrium is called <em>sublimation point</em> 
    and the line at which they co-exist is called the <em>sublimation line</em> 
    or hoar-frost line. The values of these temperatures change with the pressure. 
    The steam line shows the variation of boiling point of water with the pressure. 
    Ice line shows the variation of melting point of water with the pressure. 
    The negative slope of this line shows the melting point of ice decreases with the 
    increase of pressure.  Sublimation line or Hoar-frost line, shows the equilibrium 
    between the ice and steam. These three lines meet at a single point 'p' called the 
    <em>triple point of water</em>. The triple point of water is 273.16 K at pressure 0.006 atm pressure.

<subsection xml:id="subsec-heat_trans">
  <title>Heat Transfer</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      It is process by which heat transfers from one location to another due to temperature difference. 
      Heat can only flow from high temperature to low temperature.  There are three processes involved 
      in heat transfer. They are conduction, convection, and radiation. 
      <ol>
        <li>
          <title>Conduction</title>
          <p>
            In this process heat is transferred through stationary matter by physical contact. 
            In microscopic level atoms and molecules are always in random motion at any temperature 
            above absolute zero. When heated these particles (atoms and molecules) gain thermal 
            energy and begin vibrating even higher amplitude knocking the neighboring particles. 
            By doing so they impart some of their energy to their neighboring particles, and so on. 
            Eventually heat is carried away from  one end of a substance to another. 
            In conduction, heat carrying  particles do not physically move from its place rather 
            they  transfer their energy to neighbors when they knock one another. 
            Every time they knock pass some of their energy to next one and returns to their original place. 
            Heat transfers from the burner of a stove through the bottom of a pan to food in the pan is 
            transferred by conduction. Conduction occurs in all states of substances  
            solid, liquid, and gas. In solids, conduction happens due to molecular vibration. 
            In gases and liquids, it is due to collisions and diffusion of the molecules during their random motion.

            Consider one end of a metallic bar [<xref ref="hotbar"/>] of length <m>l</m> and area of cross-section <m>A</m>  
            is kept  at hot temperature <m>T_{h}^{o}C</m> and another end is kept at cold temperature 
            <m>T_{c}^{o}C</m>, then the amount of heat, <m>Q</m> transfers through this bar 
            at time <m>t</m> can be found experimentally as

            combining these all, we get -

          Hence,\quad Q \propto \frac{A \Delta T t}{l}

         where <m>\kappa</m> is a proportionality constant, known as coefficient of thermal conduction

            where <m>\,dx</m> is a length of the bar. That is, the rate of heat flow at 
            any point is proportional to the temperature gradient (how fast the temperature 
            is changing with position).

          <p>
            In this process heat transfer occurs by the actual movement of fluid particles. 
            Convection heat transfer is energy transport due to bulk fluid motion. 
            Convection happens in gases and liquids.

          <p>
            When a fluid is heated, its molecules which are in contact with the hot 
            surface get hot and expand. That is, the fluid above a hot surface expands, 
            becomes less dense, and rises. It carries the thermal energy along when rises up. 
            The relatively cold fluid on the upper surface is heavier and sink down near the heat source. 
            Hence a current of heat cycle develops in the convection process, called convection cycle. 
            The rate of heat flow in convection process is given by
           <men xml:id="eqn-heat_tr6">
            H=\frac{Q}{t}=hA(T_{s}-T_{f})

            of fluid receiving heat, <m>T_{s},</m> and <m> T_{\infty}</m> are temperature of hot 
            surface and cold fluid, respectively. The unit of <m>h</m> is <m>W/m^{2}.\,^{o}C.</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Radiation</title>
          <p>
            It is the process in which heat transfer without the need of intervening medium. 
            Heat transfer occurs in this process when electromagnetic waves emitted or absorbed. 
            The warming of the earth surface by the Sun is due to radiation. Heat transfer by 
            this process is the fastest one. All bodies above absolute zero emit thermal radiation. 
            At room temperature the radiation is in the infrared range, wavelengths longer 
            than those of the visible spectrum. In atomic domain, the radiation is caused 
            because of oscillating ions and electrons in a warm solid are accelerating 
            electric charges, such charges radiate. Different substances radiate with 
            different efficiencies. The good radiator of radiation is a good absorber of radiation. 
            A perfect absorber is called a <term>black body</term> (such perfection is not found in nature, 
            but some things are close). Hence a black body is also a perfect radiator. 
            A black body  absorbs and emits radiation of all most all frequencies. 
            It was found experimentally that heat energy radiated per unit time per unit 
            surface area of a perfectly black body is proportional to the fourth power of 
            its absolute temperature. This statement is also called <term>Stefan-Boltzmann law</term>. 
            That is, 
            <me>
              \frac{E}{tA}\propto T^{4}
            </me>
             <men xml:id="eqn-heat_tr7">
              \therefore \quad P  =  \sigma A \epsilon T^{4}
            </men>
                      where <m>\sigma =  5.67\times10^{-8} \,W/m^{2}.K^{4}</m> is called Stefan-Boltzmann
                      constant and <m>\epsilon</m> is called <em>emissivity</em> of the object. 
                      For a perfect black body <m>\epsilon=1.</m>  If <m>T</m> and <m>T_{o} </m> 
                      be the temperatures of the body and its surroundings then, net rate of heat loss, 
                      <me>
                        P=\sigma A \epsilon \left(T^{4}-T_{o}^{4}\right)
                      </me>
                        For any particular wavelength and temperature the amount of thermal radiation 
                        emitted depends on the emissivity of the object's surface. <term>Emissivity</term> 
                        is defined as the ratio of the energy radiated from a material's surface to 
                        that radiated from a blackbody at the same temperature and wavelength under 
                        the same viewing conditions. It is a dimensionless number between 0 (for a perfect reflector) 
                        and 1 (for a perfect emitter). The emissivity of a surface depends not only on 
                        the material but also on the <em>nature of the surface</em>. For example, a clean and 
                        polished metal surface will have a low emissivity, whereas a roughened and 
                        oxidized metal surface will have a high emissivity. The emissivity also depends 
                        on the temperature of the surface as well as wavelength and angle.

    </p>
<p>
  To calculate temperature, heat transfer, and energy balance in various systems or to 
  understand the transfer of energy (heat) as electromagnetic radiation between 
  objects the following terminologies are very important to know.
  <ol>
    <li>
      <title><term>Emissive Power</term></title>
      <p>
        It is defined as the radiant energy emitted per unit time per unit surface 
        area of the body at a particular temperature within a unit wavelength range.  
        Emissive power represents the rate at which an object emits electromagnetic radiation, 
        typically in the form of thermal radiation (infrared radiation) due to its temperature. 
        Emissive power depends on the temperature of the object and its emissivity. 
        Emissivity is a material property that describes how efficiently an object can emit 
        radiation compared to an ideal black body, which has an emissivity of 1. 
        Objects with higher emissivity values emit radiation more effectively. 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <title><term>Absorptive Power</term></title>
      <p>
        It is defined as the ratio of radiant energy absorbed per unit time per unit 
        surface area of the body to the total energy falling per unit time on 
        the same area at a particular temperature within a unit wavelength range. 
        Absorptive power represents the ability of an object to absorb electromagnetic radiation. 
        It is the complement of reflectivity and is related to how efficiently a material can absorb 
        incoming radiation. Materials with high absorptivity values absorb more radiation 
        and convert it into thermal energy. Absorptivity, like emissivity, is also a material 
        property and varies with wavelength. It is a unitless value between 0 and 1.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <title><term>Kirchhoff's Law</term></title>
      <p>
        Kirchhoff has two fundamental principles in the study of thermal radiation 
        and the behavior of materials with regard to electromagnetic radiation. 
        The details of Kirchhoff's law is not a part of discussion here but only taken here for some information.
        Kirchhoff's first law states that at any temperature, the ratio of the emissive power to the 
        absorptive power for a given wavelength is the same for all bodies and is 
        equal to the emissive power of a perfectly black body. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, this law states that the emissivity (<m>\epsilon</m>) of an object 
        at a particular wavelength is equal to its absorptivity (<m>\alpha</m>) at that same wavelength. That is,
        <me>
          \epsilon (\lambda) = \alpha(\lambda)
        </me>
        the amount of radiation that an object emits at a specific wavelength is equal 
        to the amount of radiation it absorbs at that same wavelength when the object 
        is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings.
      </p> 
      <p>
        Kirchhoff's second law states that at every temperature and for every wavelength, 
        the emissivity (<m>\epsilon</m>) of a perfect black body is equal to 1. That is,
        <me>
          \epsilon (\lambda) =1
        </me>
        a perfect black body is an idealized object that absorbs all incident radiation 
        and emits radiation at the maximum possible rate for a given temperature. 
        It is often used as a reference to compare the behavior of real objects in radiative heat transfer.

    its surroundings, respectively. Let <m>\frac{\,dQ}{\,dt}</m> be the rate 
    of loss of heat, then from Newton's law of cooling -
    <me>
      \frac{\,dQ}{\,dt} \propto \left(\theta-\theta_{o}\right)
    </me>
    <men xml:id="eqn-newton_cool1">
      \text{or,}\quad \frac{\,dQ}{\,dt} =\kappa \left(\theta-\theta_{o}\right) 
    </men>
    where <m> \kappa</m> is a constant. If <m>m</m> be the mass of a body and 
   <m>c</m> be its specific heat capacity, then 
   <me>
    Q=mc\theta
   </me>
   <men xml:id="eqn-newton_cool2">
    \therefore\quad \frac{\,dQ}{\,dt} = mc \frac{\,d\theta}{\,dt} 
   </men>
   From eqns. <xref ref="eqn-newton_cool1"/> and <xref ref="eqn-newton_cool2"/>we have -
   <me>
    mc \frac{\,d\theta}{\,dt} =\kappa \left(\theta-\theta_{o}\right)
   </me>
   <me>
    \text{or,}\quad  \frac{\,d\theta}{\,dt} = \frac{\kappa}{mc}\left(\theta-\theta_{o}\right)
   </me>
   <me>
    \therefore\quad  \frac{\,d\theta}{\,dt} \propto  \left(\theta-\theta_{o}\right) 
   </me>
   This is known as Newton's law of cooling. Here <m> \kappa,\, m</m> and <m>c</m> are constant.

    It is the rate at which solar energy received by the unit surface area of the earth,

    If <m>R_{s}</m> be the radius of the sun and <m>T</m> be its surface temperature, 
    then by considering the sun as a perfect black body, solar energy radiated by 
    the sun surface is given by 
    <me>
      P=\sigma \left(4\pi R_{s}^{2}\right) T^{4}
    </me>
    If <m>r=1.496\times10^{11} \,m</m> be the mean sun-earth distance then sun's 
    energy is radiated in the spherical surface of area <m>4\pi r^{2} </m>. 
    Hence the energy received by unit surface on the earth is 
    <me>
      S=\frac{P}{ 4\pi r^{2}}
    </me>
    <me>
      = \frac{\sigma \left(4\pi R_{s}^{2}\right) T^{4}}{4\pi r^{2}} = \sigma T^{4}\left(\frac{R_{s}}{r}\right)^{2}
    </me>
    <me>
      \text{or,}\quad T^{4}=\frac{S}{\sigma}\left(\frac{r}{R_{s}}\right)^{2}

      \therefore\quad T =\sqrt[4]{\frac{S}{\sigma}\left(\frac{r}{R_{s}}\right)^{2}}
