 <title>Thermodynamics</title>
 
<introduction>
    <p>
        The word <term>thermodynamics</term> was coined by Lord Kelvin in 1849. 
        It is a combination of two words, <em>thermo</em> that refers heat and 
        <em>dynamics</em> that refers force or motion of the molecules or atoms. 
        It is the branch of physics which deals with heat energy, its transfer, 
        and energy conversion. It begins its journey with the development of fire. 
        People used to believe that every substance has some amount of invisible 
        fluid called caloric fluid. When it moves from one object to another the 
        object becomes hot or cold. The object which loses caloric fluid becomes 
        cold and which gains caloric fluid becomes hot. We know now that there is 
        nothing like caloric fluid but it is a heat energy which exists in a material 
        due to molecular vibration. Heat is a form of energy that can flow due to 
        temperature difference. We can obtain an infinite amount of heat energy out 
        of the material. For example, we can produced an infinite amount of heat from 
        water by performing a continuous mechanical work (as in <em>Joul's experiment</em> <xref ref="jouleexpt"/>) 
        without changing the condition of water. Work is also an energy that is transferred 
        from one system to another without considering the temperature difference between them. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There are several processes in nature which occur always in a particular fashion. 
        For examples, <em>water falls from a high elevation to low elevation,</em> <em>heat flows from 
        high temperature to low temperature</em>, <em>current flows from high electric potential to low electric potential</em>, 
        in diffusion <em>molecules flows from high concentration to low concentration</em>, 
        <em>we grow older not younger</em>, <em>our hair turns gray not black as we go older</em>, 
        and so on. Even in the conversion of mechanical energy into heat energy, for example 
        if you rub your right hand finger on the palm of left hand (mechanical work) you produce a 
        heat but reverse does not seem to happen. Yes, some events can happen in both directions, 
        for example you can heat a gas and you can cool a gas, you expand a gas and compress a gas, 
        etc but even in that processes we can see there are some changes happen in the surroundings. 
        We will discuss those events later in second law of thermodynamics which talks about the 
        directional property of heat energy and its conversion. The conversion of mechanical energy 
        into electrical energy and vice a versa is 100% possible in ideal case but if we want to 
        convert heat energy into mechanical work (energy) then 100% conversion is not possible 
        even in the ideal  case. However, we can convert all of our mechanical energy into heat energy. 
        Hence we can tell that the nature always follows a certain pattern to have some process to occur. 
        Nature obeyes simple and universal laws that can be expressed in the mathematical language. 
        <em>Thermodynamics</em> is thus a fundamental subject of nature that describes the basic laws governing 
        the physical process and its occurrence associated with the transfer of energy and its conversion. 
        It is based on our common experience, observation, and experimentation. It has two parts in 
        observational points of view, that is microscopic view (statistical thermodynamics) 
        and macroscopic view (classical thermodynamics). The characteristic of the over all behavior 
        the system can be sensed in classical thermodynamics. The behavior of system on the basis of 
        its molecular property can be studied in statistical thermodynamics. That is, the classical 
        <em>thermodynamics is an average outcome of statistical thermodynamics</em>. 
        <em>Thermodynamics provides a very important aspects of our life that tells us which process 
        in nature can only occur and which process can not occur. </em>

        To understand the thermodynamical process we need to know about the system and surroundings. 
        The system is the part of the universe being studied, while the surroundings are the rest 
        of the universe that interacts with the system. The <em>system and surroundings</em> are separated 
        by a hypothetical line called a <em>boundary</em>. It may be real or imaginary, for example 
        water in a beaker is separated from rest of the room, then the beaker behaves as a boundary, 
        water as a system, and the rest of the room as surroundings. In other word, a <term>system</term> is a 
        definite amount of matter bounded by a closed surface. Anything outside of this closed 
        surface is called a <term>surroundings</term>. The closed surface is a boundary which 
        separates the system and the surroundings. The boundary may be real or imaginary, 
        it may be fixed, flexible, or distorted. System and surroundings must interact with 
        each other by exchanging energy of any forms. System which can exchange energy and 
        matter both with the surroundings is called <alert>open system</alert>. For example, 
        boiling water in an open pot. If the system can exchange only energy but not the matter 
        with its surroundings then system is called a <alert>closed system</alert>. For example, 
        a cup of coffee with a lid on it. Some system neither exchange energy nor the matter 
        with its surroundings then it is called an <alert>isolated system</alert>. 
        For example, a thermos flask.

    <title>Thermodynamical Variables</title>
    <p>
        The state of a thermodynamic system can be specified in terms of macroscopic state 
        variables such as volume, V, temperature, T,  and pressure, p. Out of these three, 
        two are independent variables while the third may be considered as their function. 
        In general, two of these parameters are needed to completely specify a thermodynamical system. 
        These two types of variables are also known as extensive and intensive variables. 
        Variables that depend on the size of a system such as volume, V, amount of substance 
        (moles, n ), entropy, S, etc. are called <term>extensive variables</term>. Variables 
        that do not depend on the size of a system such as temperature, T, pressure, p , density,

    <introduction>
        <p>
            The laws of thermodynamics define fundamental physical quantities such as temperature, 
            energy, and entropy that characterize thermodynamic systems. 
            There are four laws of thermodynamics.

            It defines the temperature and states the thermal equilibrium condition. 
            Thermal equilibrium is a state achieved by two or more systems after being 
            in contact with one another through a diathermic wall. If an object with 
            a higher temperature comes in contact with another object at a lower temperature, 
            it will transfer some of its heat energy to the object at lower temperature 
            till they come to the same temperature. If two systems are each in thermal 
            equilibrium with a third system, then they must be in thermal equilibrium 
            with each other. If <em>temperature of object A = temperature of object C 
            and temperature of object B = temperature of object C, 
            then temperature of object A = temperature of object B</em> [<xref ref="zeroth"/>].

            The first law is a consequence of conservation of energy and requires that a 
            system may exchange energy with its surroundings strictly by heat flow or work. 
            Joule has established the equivalence between heat and mechanical work as 
            <me>
                W=JQ,
            </me>
           where W is amount of work done (in joule) on the system, Q is the amount of heat 
           (in calorie) produced in the system, and J is a mechanical equivalent of heat 
           also known as Joule's constant. The value of <m>J</m> is <m>4.1860 \,J/cal</m>. 
           The first law states that when a given amount of work, W is done on a system, 
           an equivalent amount of heat, Q is produced or when a certain amount of heat, Q 
           disappears from the system an equivalent amount of work W is obtained. 
           The equivalence is given by the constant <m>J</m>. Heat is thus a form of energy.

        <p>
            The Joule apparatus [<xref ref="jouleexpt"/>] consisted of a weight suspended by string over a pulley, 
            which in turn was wound around a winding drum. As long as the drum remained 
            stationary, the weight remained at rest. When the drum was released, the weight 
            was set free to fall, and its potential energy began converting to kinetic energy. 
            In the process, the string attached to the weight unwound from the drum, 
            which caused the drum to turn and along with it the paddle wheel attached to it. 
            The rotating paddles agitated the water, causing its temperature to rise. 
            Joule concluded from this experiment that the mechanical energy of the spinning paddle 
            wheel had been converted into heat energy, which raise the temperature of the water. 
            Joule's experiment thus proved the link between potential, kinetic, mechanical, 
            and heat energies. Joule's experiment thus helped establish the principle of 
            conservation of energy. <idx>Joul's experiment </idx>

            Let us consider a system which absorbed <m>Q</m> amount of heat and does <m>W</m> 
            work done while going from initial state <m>i</m> to the final state <m>f</m>. 
            The final state reached by the system may be achieved by the different paths 
            but the quantity <m>Q-W</m> is the same. The quantity <m>Q-W</m> is known as 
            the change in internal energy <m>\Delta U </m> of the system.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider a gas cylinder [<xref ref="Ilawtherm"/>] with frictionless piston 
            placed on a hot bath, then the change in internal energy of the cylinder is given by 
            <men xml:id="eqn-Ilaw1">
                \,dU = \,dQ-\,dW 
            </men>
          where <m> \,dQ </m> is the amount of heat energy absorbed by the gas, 
          and <m>\,dW</m> is the amount of work done by the gas in moving its piston 
          from position <m>i</m> to <m>f</m>. This is the mathematical form of I law of thermodynamics. 
          The <em>I law </em> establishes an exact relation between heat and work. This tells us that 
         <em> it is impossible to get the work from any machine without giving it an equivalent 
          amount of energy in any form</em>.

            <term>Quasi static state:</term> A process during which the system only deviates 
            from equilibrium by an infinitessimal amount. This may happen if the gas is allowed 
            to expand or compress very slowly. As the piston compresses the pressure inside the 
            gas remains very nearly uniform at all times during the process. So, the system 
            never deviates significantly from mechanical equilibrium. Quasi static process is 
            also a reversible process. A system is in thermodynamical equilibrium if it has achieved: 
            mechanical equilibrium, chemical equilibrium, and thermal equilibrium. 
            Thermodynamic variables like temperature, pressure etc. can only be used to 
            describe the system that has achieved thermodynamical equilibrium.

        <title>Second Law of Thermodunamics</title>
      <p>
        The first law of thermodynamics gives an equivalence between the quantity of heat 
        and the mechanical work or vice-versa. This law does not tell the limitation and 
        condition of conversion. That is how much heat is converted into work and whether 
        the transformaiton itself can take place or not. The first law does not tell anything 
        about the direction of transformation of energy.  It  does not indicate whether heat 
        can flow from a cold end to a hot end or not. The first law places no restriction on 
        the direction of a process, and satisfying the first law does not guarantee that the process 
        will occur.  In practice, it is not possible to convert the heat energy into an equivalent 
        amount of work. Thus, we need another general principle  to identify whether a process 
        can occur or not. The law specifying the condition of transformation of heat into work 
        is called the second law of thermodynamics. The second law of thermodynamics tells the 
        direction of the flow of heat. It also tells that heat energy cannot be completely 
        converted into equivalent work.

        The engine does not violate any law by itself, but if the refrigerator and engine 
        combined together [<xref ref="he4"/>], they form a device that takes in heat 
        <m>Q_{h}-Q_{c}</m> from the hot body and converts all into work without delivering

        Heat engine is a device of converting heat continuously into work. The device absorbs 
        heat from a high temperature reservoir, converts part of this energy into work and 
        rejects the rest of the energy as heat to a low temperature drain. Hence, it consists of 
        three essential parts: <em>Source</em> or reservoir for the supply of heat at high temperature. 
        <em>Sink </em> or drain for the rejection of heat at lower temperature. 
        <em>Working Substance</em> which absorbs heat from the source. 
       </p> 
       <p>
        The working substance undergoes a cycle of operation in which it absorbs certain quantity 
        of heat from the source, converts a part of it into work and  rejected rest to the 
        sink as shown in <xref ref="he5"/>. Finally it reaches to the initial stage where 
        its internal energy is the same. By performing the same cycle again and again, 
        heat is continuously converted into work.

           and converted to work with no other change in the system of surroundings. Carnot 
           presented theoretically an ideal heat engine, free from all imperfection of actual engines. 
           The engine operates between source and sink each of which is maintained at 
           constant temperature. The engine is known as a Caront's engine and its cycle of operation 
           as the Carnot's cycle. The schematics of engine is shown in <xref ref="carnte"/>. 
           The working substance is an ideal gas contained in an insulated cylinder with conducting 
           bottom surface. A hot body of high thermal capacity maintained at a constant temperature 
           <m>T_{h} \,K</m> serves as a source. A cold body maintained at a constant temperature

        <p>
            A reversible process is defined as a process that can be reversed without leaving any trace
            on the surroundings. It means both system and surroundings are returned to their initial
            states at the end of the reverse process. Processes that are not reversible are called
            irreversible.            
        </p>
           <p>
            Reversible heat engine is just the heat engine which is running in the reverse direction 
            of heat engine. In reversible heat engine all the three components re-assume exactly 
            their original conditions and no changes are left in the surroundings. Such an engine can 
            be realized if, the engine is free from friction, the process is infinitely slow, and working 
            substance never differs appreciable from its surroundings. No heat engine can have efficiency 
            greater than a reversible heat engine.

            <idx>isothermal expansion</idx> Consider a mole of gas as a working substance in a cylinder [<xref ref="carntc"/>]. 
           The initial state  of the gas is <m>(p_{1},V_{1})</m> denoted by point 
           A in the figure 10.25 and it's temperature is the same as that of source <m>T_{h}\, K</m>.

           absorbed by the gas. The final state <m>(p_{2},V_{2})</m> of the gas is represented by a point B. 
           Because none of the heat goes into changing the temperature of the gas, all of the heat goes into 
           pushing the piston up as the gas expands. Thus all of the heat, <m>Q_{h}</m> is turned into work, <m>W_{1}.</m> 
           That is,

            Consider two engines I and R working between the same two temperatures where I is 
            irreversible and R is reversible. The two engines are so designed  that they perform 
            equal amount of work. If  engine R draws <m>Q_{r}</m> amount of heat from source does

            perform the same amount of work W, and rejects the <m> Q_{i}-W</m> to the sink,

                as a self acting machine. Since the work needed to run the refrigerator R is supplied

            This is also the net amount of heat rejected to the source.That is  this device transfers 
            the same amount of heat <m> Q_{r}-Q_{i} </m> from the sink to the source without the aid 
            of any external source. This violates the second law of thermodynamics. Hence an irreversible 
            engine never be more efficient than the reversible one.

               <p>
                Now consider the reversible engines <m>R_{1}</m> and <m> R_{2}</m> are working between the

            Heat flows from hot body to cold body naturally. The reverse process, 
            however, cannot occur by itself. To transfer heat from a low temperature 
            region to a high temperature requires special devices called refrigerators or heat pump. 
            Heat pumps transfer heat from a low temperature medium to a high temperature one. 
            Refrigerators and heat pumps are essentially the same devices; they differ in their 
            objectives only. Refrigerator is to maintain the refrigerated space at a low temperature. 
            On the other hand, a heat pump absorbs heat from a low temperature source and supplies 
            the heat to a warmer medium. Heat pumps and refrigerators are heat engine working in 
            backward direction. They transfer heat from cold to hot.

            A natural tendency of systems is to lose order. When sugar is dissolved in water it becomes more randomized and 
            will not reconstitute itself in the crystalline form again, unless we apply heat energy from outside of the system 
            to evaporate water. When a hot and a cold body are put in contact to each other, heat energy begins to flow from 
            the hot body to the cold body until they reach at thermal equilibrium. Heat will never move back the other way. 
            To move heat from a cold body to a hot body an external work must be done by an external source such as a heat pump. 
            <term>Entropy</term> is a measure of that disorderness. It is a measure of the system's thermal energy per 
            unit temperature that is unavailable for useful work. The concept of entropy provides the direction of 
            spontaneous change for many process. It tells us that which process is allowed and which is completely 
            prohibited even if it can not violet the fundamental law of conservation of energy. An ice cube placed 
            on a hot pan surely melts, while the pan goes cooler. Such a process is called irreversible because no 
            slight change will cause the melted water to turn back into ice while the pan goes hotter. In contrast, 
            a block of ice placed in an ice water bath will either thaw a little more or freeze a little more, 
            depending on whether a small amount of heat is added to or taken out from the system. Such a process 
            is reversible because only an infinitesimal amount of heat is needed to change its direction from 
            progressive freezing to progressive thawing.

            Spontaneous change for an irreversible process in an isolated system always proceeds 
            in a direction of increasing entropy. Entropy describes the degradation of energy 
            to perform work. Crystals are more orderly than salt molecules in solution; however, 
            vaporized water is  more disordered than liquid water. The process taken as a whole 
            results in a net increase in disorder. The first law of thermodynamics is the conservation of energy 
            and is easy to express quantitatively. The second law explains that heat only flows 
            from a hotter object to a colder one. It measures quantitatively that the efficiency 
            of any reversible engine has to equal that of the Carnot cycle, and any irreversible 
            engine has less efficiency. In the view of measuring the amount of irreversibility 
            Clausius described a parameter, called <em>entropy</em> that doesn't change in a 
            reversible process but always increases in an irreversible one.

            The total work done by the gas is the area of the curve ABCD. 
            Hence the work done must be just the difference between the heat supplied at 
            <m>T_{h}</m> and that dumped at <m>T_{c}.</m> Now the heat supplied along the 
            initial hot isothermal path AB is equal to the work done along that curve, 
            <me>
                Q_{h}=nRT_{h}\ln\frac{V_{b}}{V_{a}}
            </me>
           and the heat dumped into the cold reservoir along CD is 
           <me>
            Q_{c}=nRT_{c}\ln\frac{V_{c}}{V_{d}}
           </me>
             </p>
             <p>
                The difference between these two is the net work output. This can be simplified using the 
                adiabatic equations for the other two sides of the cycle: 
                <me>
                    T_{h}V_{b}^{\gamma-1} =  T_{c}V_{c}^{\gamma-1}
                </me>
                        and
                        <me>
                            T_{h}V_{a}^{\gamma-1} =  T_{c}V_{d}^{\gamma-1}
                        </me>
                         On dividing of these two equations, we get - 
                         <me>
                            \frac{V_{b}}{V_{a}} =\frac{V_{c}}{V_{d}} 
                         </me>
                         and using that in the preceding equation for <m>Q_{c},</m> 
                         <me>
                            Q_{c}=nRT_{c}\ln\frac{V_{b}}{V_{a}} = T_{c} \frac{Q_{h}}{T_{h}}
                         </me>
                         <me>
                            \text{or,}\quad \frac{Q_{c}}{Q_{h}}=  \frac{T_{c}}{T_{h}}
                         </me>
                         <me>
                            \text{or,}\quad \frac{Q_{c}}{T_{c}}=  \frac{Q_{h}}{T_{h}}
                         </me>
                         So for the Carnot cycle the ratio of heat supplied to heat dumped is just the ratio of the 
                         absolute temperatures. If we draw many isotherms and many adiabatics curve, 
                         then we can find in general that 
                         <me>
                            \frac{Q_{1}}{T_{1}}=  \frac{Q_{2}}{T_{2}} =  \frac{Q_{3}}{T_{3}} = \cdots =  \frac{Q}{T} = constant
                         </me>
                         This quantity <m>\frac{Q}{T}</m> is a definite thermal property of the working substance. 
                         During adiabatic change, there is no transfer of heat so this quantity is zero. 
                         Hence that thermal property of the substance which remains constant during 
                         an adiabatic change is termed as <em>entropy</em>.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                Now let see what happen if we take the path ADCBA. The amount of heat absorbed at temperature 
                <m> T_{h}</m> when the gas passes from the state A to the state B remains constant even 
                if a path other than the isotherm AB is followed. Now starting from the point A 
                in reverse direction, let the path AD, DC, and CB be followed. Along the adiabatics 
                AD and CB the quantity <m>\frac{Q}{T} </m> is zero and the quantity along the isothermal 
                DC <m>=\frac{Q_{c}}{T_{c}}.</m> But we know that 
                <me>
                    \frac{Q_{c}}{T_{c}}= \frac{Q_{h}}{T_{h}}
                </me>
                 Hence the quantity <m>\int\limits_{i}^{f} \frac{Q}{T}</m> is independent of the 
                 manner of transformation, i.e., the entropy is a definite function of the thermal 
                 state of a body and is not affected in any way by the manner in which the particular 
                 state is reached. In other words, <em>entropy is a definite physical entity like pressure, 
                 volume, temperature, or internal energy but there is nothing physical to represent it</em>. 
                 Entropy can not be felt like pressure or temperature. Further, we can not measure the absolute 
                 entropy of a substance in any situation, we can only measure the change in entropy as the 
                 substance moves from one state to another. Entropy is denoted by a letter, <m>S</m>.               
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Change of entropy = heat energy/temperature 
                                </p>
                                    <p>
                                        or, Change of entropy <m>\times</m> Temperature = Heat Energy. 
                                    </p> 
                                    <p>
                                        That is the dimension of heat energy is same as that of the product of entropy and temperature.  
                                        If we compare, gravitational potential energy <m>\propto</m> mass <m>\times</m> height with 
                                        the above expression then it seems like, entropy bears to heat motion in the same fashion 
                                        as mass bears to linear motion. Hence entropy is also known as a thermal inertia. 
                                        The second law of thermodynamics can be stated in terms of entropy. 
                                        The total entropy of the universe is continually increasing because all 
                                        natural process is irreversible and entropy increases in irreversible process 
                                        where as there is no change in entropy in the reversible process. 
                                        But reversible process barely happen in the universe.

        <title>Principle of increase of entropy:</title>
        <p>
            According to this principle, entropy of the universe always increases 
            for any irreversible process, or remains constant for a reversible process.

<ol marker="i.">
    <li>
         <em>Change of entropy of the universe due to reversible process:</em> Consider a Carnot cycle 
            in isothermal expansion. The increase of entropy of the working substance 
            is equal to <m>\frac{Q_{h}}{T_{h}}.</m>  The decrease of entropy of the source is equal to 
            <m>\frac{Q_{h}}{T_{h}}. </m> Thus the net change of entropy of universe during a reversible 
            isothermal process is <em>zero</em>. There is no change of entropy during adiabatic process. 
            Similarly, the decrease of entropy of the working substance during  isothermal compression 
            is <m>\frac{Q_{c}}{T_{c}},</m> the increases of entropy of the sink during isothermal 
            compression is <m>\frac{Q_{c}}{T_{c}}.</m>
            Therefore, net change of entropy of the universe is zero. Now take the entire Carnot cycle 
            at once, then loss of entropy of the source (surrounding) is 
            <m>\frac{Q_{h}}{T_{h}}</m> and gains of entropy of the sink (surrounding) is <m>\frac{Q_{c}}{T_{c}}</m>, 
            hence the net change of entropy of the universe,
            <me>
                \,dS=\frac{Q_{c}}{T_{c}} -\frac{Q_{h}}{T_{h}}=0
            </me>
            <me>
                \therefore \quad \frac{Q_{c}}{T_{c}} =\frac{Q_{h}}{T_{h}}
            </me>
             The entropy of the whole system remains constant.  
          </li>
    <li>
        <em>Change of entropy of the universe due to irreversible process:</em> 
        Consider a heat transfer in conduction process. It is an irreversible process. 
        Let a quantity <m>\,dQ </m> be transferred from a hot body A at a temperature 
        <m>T_{h}</m> to a cold body B at temperature <m>T_{c}.</m> The loss of entropy 
        of A is <m>\frac{\,dQ}{T_{h}}</m> and the gain of entropy of B is <m>\frac{\,dQ}{T_{c}}.</m> 
        Thus the net change in entropy is 
        <me>
            \,dS= \frac{\,dQ}{T_{c}}-\frac{\,dQ}{T_{h}}  = +ve
        </me>
        Since <m>T_{h} \gt T_{c}</m>. Therefore the entropy of the system as a whole 
        increase during this process. The entropy of the universe increases in the irreversible process.

      <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-entropy_degrad">
        <title>Principle of degradation of entropy:</title>
        <p>
            It states that the available energy of the universe is tending towards zero. 
            From the second law whenever an irreversible process takes place, a certain 
            quantity of energy of the universe is converted from a form in which it is 
            unavailable for work. In Carnot engine, <m>Q_{h}</m> is the heat that is 
            taken from a source and <m>Q_{c}</m> is the amount of heat given to the sink. 
            The difference of this heat <m> Q_{h}-Q_{c}</m> is converted into work and 
            is called the <term>available energy</term>. 
            Available energy is therefore, 
            <me>
                Q_{h}-Q_{c} = Q_{h}\left(1-\frac{Q_{c}}{Q_{h}}\right)  = Q_{h}\left(1-\frac{T_{c}}{T_{h}}\right)
            </me>
            <m>\left[\because  \frac{Q_{c}}{Q_{h}}=\frac{T_{c}}{T_{h}} \right]</m>
          Thus the lower the temperature <m>T_{c}</m> of the sink, the greater will be the available energy. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Now consider an irreversible process in which heat Q is transferred from hot 
            body at temperature <m>T_{h}</m> to a cold body at temperature <m>T_{c}.</m> 
            Suppose <m>T_{o}</m> is the lowest available temperature in the system, 
            then available energy to start with is <m>Q\left(1-\frac{T_{o}}{T_{h}}\right).</m>
            After transfer it becomes <m>Q\left(1-\frac{T_{o}}{T_{c}}\right).</m> 
            Hence the loss available energy in the process of transformation is 
            <me>
                Q\left(1-\frac{T_{o}}{T_{h}}\right)- Q\left(1-\frac{T_{o}}{T_{c}}\right)
            </me>
            <me>
                = Q\left[\frac{T_{o}}{T_{c}}-\frac{T_{o}}{T_{h}}\right] = T_{o}\left(\frac{Q}{T_{c}}-\frac{Q}{T_{h}} \right)=T_{o}\,dS.
            </me>
            Since <m>\,dS</m> is increasing in irreversible process available energy is decreasing. 
            All natural process are irreversible the available energy of the universe is 
            continually decreasing.  When a state of maximum entropy of the universe is 
            reached there would be no available energy to do any work, this condition 
            is called the <term>heat-death</term>.

        <p>
            Entropy is intimately connected with the probability. 
            If you toss four pennies, then it has very less chance that all four 
            will land heads up. It is six times more likely to get two heads and two 
            tails up. The two heads - two tails state is the most likely, shows the most disorder, 
            and has the highest entropy. Four heads is less likely, has the most order, 
            and the lowest entropy. If you tossed more coins, it would be even less likely 
            that they'd all land heads up, and even more likely that you'd end up 
            with close to the same number of heads as tails.

            Let S be entropy and <m>\omega</m> be the maximum probability of the 
            system in a definite state, then we can write 
            <me>
                S=f(\omega)

           Now consider <m>S_{1}</m> and <m>S_{2}</m> are the entropies of the two

           entropy is an additive quantity. The probability of a composite system 
           is equal to the product of the probabilities of the individual system. That is,

            \omega = \omega_{1}\omega_{2}

       <men xml:id="eqn-entr_prob4">
        \omega_{1}f'(\omega_{1}\omega_{2}) = f'(\omega_{2})  
       </men>
    Dividing eqns. <xref ref="eqn-entr_prob3"/> and <xref ref="eqn-entr_prob4"/>, we get - 
    <men xml:id="eqn-entr_prob5">
        \frac{\omega_{2}}{\omega_{1}} = \frac{f'(\omega_{1})}{f'(\omega_{2})}
    </men>
    <me>
        \text{or,}\quad \omega_{1} f'(\omega_{1}) =\omega_{2} f'(\omega_{2}) = k,\quad \text{constant}
    </me>
    So that 
    <me>
        f'(\omega_{1}) = \frac{k}{\omega_{1}}\qquad \text{and}\quad  f'(\omega_{2}) = \frac{k}{\omega_{2}}
    </me>
    Integrating these expressions, we get - 
    <me>
        \int f'(\omega_{1})\,d\omega_{1} = \int \frac{k}{\omega_{1}}\,d\omega_{1}
    </me>
    <men xml:id="eqn-entr_prob6">
        \therefore\quad f(\omega_{1}) = k\ln\omega_{1}+C 
    </men>
   also, 
   <me>
    \int f'(\omega_{2})\,d\omega_{2} = \int \frac{k}{\omega_{2}}\,d\omega_{2}
   </me>
   <men xml:id="eqn-entr_prob7">
    \therefore\quad f(\omega_{2}) = k\ln\omega_{2}+C 
   </men>
   In general, 
   <me>
    f(\omega) = k\ln\omega+C
   </me>
   <me>
    \text{or,}\quad S =   k\ln\omega+C 
   </me>
   Where C is a constant of integration which can be determined by 
   initial conditions. In case of a perfect order, <m>\omega=1</m> 
   and <m>S=0 </m>, then <m>C =0.</m> 
   <me>
    \therefore \quad S =k\ln \omega
   </me>
   Hence the microscopic definition of entropy is given by 
   <men xml:id="eqn-entr_prob8">
    S = N k_{B} ln \omega  
   </men>
   Where <m> k=Nk_{B}</m> for N number of molecules of gas and <m>k_{B} </m> is Boltzmann constant.

        <title>Third Law of Thermodynamics</title>
        <p>
            From now we may have known that the entropy difference between two points like the 
            potential energy. Where we must define the base line to calculate the potential energy. 
            We already have a natural base line thermodynamically, a system at absolute zero 
            has zero entropy. This is sometimes called the third law of thermodynamics. 
            The efficiency of Carnot engine, 
            <me>
                \eta= 1-\frac{T_{c}}{T_{h}} 
            </me>
            If <m> T_{c} =0,</m> <m>\eta =1,</m> i.e., <m>100\% </m>efficient. 
            It means if the temperature of the sink be zero, then complete 
            conversion of heat into work is possible.  But further lowering of 
            temperature if it is already sufficiently low is not easy. 
            Hence, third law states that it is impossible by any procedure 
            to reduce temperature of any system to absolute zero.
