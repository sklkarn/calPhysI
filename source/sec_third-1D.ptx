  <title>1D Kinematics</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Kinematics analyzes the positions and motions of objects as a function of time, 
      without regard to the causes of motion. It involves the relationships between 
      displacement (<m>\vec{s}</m>), velocity (<m>\vec{v}</m>), acceleration 
      (<m>\vec{a}</m>), and time (t). The motion of object along one dimension has been 
      analyzed in one dimensional (1D) kinematics.

          The speedometer needle in a moving car gives instantaneous velocity of the car. 
          Theoretically, it should be measured in the shortest time slice possible (<m>\Delta t \to 0</m>).

    The slope in <m>v</m> <em>vs.</em> <m>t</m> graph gives instantaneous acceleration and the area 
    between the velocity curve and the time axis gives the displacement. 
    Acceleration relates to velocity in <m>v \sim  t</m> graph in the same manner as velocity

    gives the instantaneous acceleration. Since the slope of the velocity curve,

      The specific features of motions can be read as follows from the graph: 
      If position, x is increasing, then velocity, v is <m>+ve</m>, if position, x is decreasing, 
      then velocity, v is <m>-ve</m>, if velocity, v is increasing, then acceleration, 
      a is <m>+ve</m>, if velocity, v is decreasing, then acceleration, a is <m>-ve</m>. 
      The slope of x <m>x \sim t </m> t graph gives velocity and the slope of <m>v \sim t</m> 
      graph gives acceleration. The area under <m> v \sim t</m> graph gives position 
      [<m>x=vt</m>] and  the area under <m>a \sim t</m> graph gives velocity [<m>v=at</m>]. 
      Note that even if the shape of these graphs look weird all the motions happen only 
      in one dimension, i.e., going up or down with time <xref first="fig3e" last="fig3f"/>.
    </p>
    <p>
      From <xref ref="fig3f"/>, slope of line AB=+ve, slope of line BC=0, 
      and slope of line CD =-ve, which means the object is running with constant 
      velocity along +ve direction, stays at rest, and again starts moving with constant 
      velocity along -ve direction, respectively. The slope of bottom portion of curve DE =0 
      nd that at top portion is +ve hence the object is speeding up in +ve direction.  The 
      slope of bottom portion of curve EF =+ve and that at top portion =0, hence the object 
      is slowing down in +ve direction. The slope of top portion of curve FG =0 and that at 
      bottom portion is -ve, hence the object is speeding up in -ve direction. The slope of 
      top portion of curve GH =-ve and that at bottom portion =0, hence the object is slowing 
      down in -ve direction as can be verified in figure <xref ref="fig3g"/>. If velocity is constant 
      there is no acceleration and if velocity is increasing in +ve direction, acceleration 
      is +ve, if velocity is decreasing in +ve direction, acceleration is -ve, if velocity is 
      increasing in -ve direction, acceleration is -ve, if velocity is decreasing in -ve direction, 
      acceleration is +ve as can be seen from graph <xref ref="fig3h"/>.

  <title>Equations of Motion</title>

      The equations of motion relate the displacement of an object with its velocity,

      We are driving three equations of motion when acceleration is constant.
