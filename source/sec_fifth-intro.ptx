  <introduction>
       <p>
      If an object is displaced along the same direction as the force is applied  
      then the <term>work</term> is said to be done. If a force <m>F</m> displaces a body to a 
      distance <m>d</m> along the direction of force then work can be calculated by 
      <m>W= Fd</m>. Work is a scalar quantity as it is a measure of transfer of energy 
      from one object to another. The physical quantities which can be obtained by dot 
      product of two vectors are scalar.

      The unit of work is joule in SI system, <m>Joule (J) =  N.m</m>;

        Suppose a block of mass <m>m</m> is displaced to a distance <m>d</m> along the 
        horizontal direction by the application of force <m>\vec{F}</m> [<xref ref="ec1"/>]. If the force 
        <m>\vec{F}</m> is acting along a direction <m>\theta</m> to the horizontal, 
        then work done by the force is given by 
        <men xml:id="eqn-work1">
          W=\vec{F}\cdot\vec{d}=Fd\cos\theta = (F\cos\theta)d = F_{x}d
        </men>
        The work done by a force is defined as the product of component 
        of the force  in the direction of displacement and the magnitude of displacement.  
        Work in physics is different than our daily life work. Suppose you are pushing a 
        rigid brick wall very hard, after some time you get exhausted because you lose 
        your body energy. In our daily life we called this action as a work, but in physics 
        this is not a work because the object did not displace from its position. Hence 
        in physics, whether the force or the displacement is zero, there is no work. 
        Depending upon the angle between the applied force and the displacement, 
        work could be negative, positive, or zero. For example, work done by a frictional 
        force, or work done by a force acting opposite to the motion of object, 
        <me>
          W_{f}=\vec{f}\cdot\vec{d} = -fd,
        </me>
       work done by a force acting parallel to the motion of object, 
       <me>
        W_{F}=\vec{F}\cdot\vec{d} = Fd\cos0^{o}=Fd,
       </me>
       and work done by a force acting perpendicular to the motion of object, 
       <me>
        W_{F}=\vec{F}\cdot\vec{d} = Fd\cos90^{o}=0.
       </me>
        </p>   
<p>
  If a force 
  <me>
    \vec{F}=F_{x} \hat{i}+ F_{y} \hat{j}+F_{z} \hat{k} 
  </me>
  displaces an object to a small distance <m>\,d\vec{r},</m> where 
  <me>
    \vec{r}=x\hat{i}+y\hat{j}+z\hat{k}
  </me>
    then work done by this force is given by <fn>If <me>
      \vec{r}=x\hat{i}+y\hat{j}+z\hat{k},
    </me>
   then 
   <me>
    \,dr = \,dx\hat{i}+\,dy\hat{j}+\,dz\hat{k}

      W=\int \vec{F}\cdot\,d\vec{r} = \int F\cos\theta\,dr = \int F_{x}\,dx+\int F_{y}\,dy+\int F_{z}\,dz

    The terms like <m>F_{x}\,dx</m> are area under the curve [<xref ref="ec4"/>]. The sum of these area between 
    initial position to final position along each direction is equal to work done by a 
    variable force F(r), such as force of spring.

  <title>Energy</title>
  
  <introduction>
         <p>
        The capacity of doing work is known as energy. It is a scalar quantity 
        and it's unit in SI system is Joule. Energy exists in many different forms, 
        such as thermal energy, sound energy, electrical energy, magnetic energy, 
        gravitational energy, chemical energy, mechanical energy, etc. 
        The energy  associated with the motion and position of an object is termed 
        as mechanical energy. We focus our understanding here in mechanical energy. 
        Mechanical energy is of two types, kinetic energy and potential energy. 
        The kinetic energy is associated with the motion of the object and potential 
        energy is associated with the position  of the object with respect to some other 
        object. For example: elastic potential energy due to a spring force, 
        gravitational potential energy due to gravity, etc. The sum of kinetic 
        and potential energy gives the total mechanical energy of the object.

   Since this kinetic energy is associated with a body in translational motion,

        <title>Potential Energy:</title>
        <p>
          The energy stored in a body due to its position is known as potential energy. 
          If work is done by a force to change the position of a body, then this work is 
          stored in the body at that position in the form of potential energy. The restoring 
          force plays a crucial role to acquire potential energy. For example, a charged particle 
          near or far from another charge;  a squashed or stretched rubber ball, a body above 
          the surface of the earth. The potential energy of the body at any position is the 
          work done against the restoring force in moving the body from the zero point 
          (reference point) to that position. The reference point <fn>The zero point is 
            so chosen that it could be infinitely far away. Such as at infinity, 
            at the center of the earth, at sea level, at the floor, at the table top, 
            or at any other point. This is because only potential energy differences 
            between two positions are physically measurable and cannot depend on the a
            rbitrary choice of the zero point.</fn>  (or, the <em>zero point</em>)

            to be done on a body to take it to a new location, then the potential energy 
            increases in the process. If the external force does the work then the 
            potential energy change is negative.

  <title>Conservative and Non-Conservative Forces</title>
  <p>
    If a body under the action of a force does no net work during any closed loop, 
    then the force is conservative, otherwise, it is non-conservative. 
    Non-conservative forces are dissipative forces such as friction or air resistance. 
    These forces take energy away from the system as the system progresses, energy that 
    you can't get back. These forces are path dependent and therefore it matters where 
    the object starts and stops. Gravity, spring force, electric and magnetic, and 
    other restoring forces are conservative. Friction, normal force, tension, and 
    other applied forces are non-conservative. Conservative forces are state function, 
    and non-conservatives forces are path function. The work done by a conservative 
    force is independent of the path, i.e., the work done by a conservative 
    force is the same for any path connecting two points.

    <title>Principle of Conservation of Energy</title>
  <p>
    It states that in an isolated system, the total energy of the system is conserved. 
    That is, energy can neither be created nor be destroyed, it can only be converted 
    from one form of energy to another. For example, when a block slides down a slope, 
    potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. When friction slows the block 
    to a stop, the kinetic energy is converted into thermal energy. In case of mechanical 
    energy the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy is conserved.

    From the principle of conservation of energy as kinetic energy of 
    the system increases its potential energy decreases. This means the 
    force acting on a particle is the rate at which the potential energy decreases 
    in any given direction as shown in <xref ref="SHMenergy"/>. At point a, the slope of 
    <m>U(x)</m> is positive, i.e., the x-component of the  force is in the negative x direction. 
    At the point b, the slope is negative and hence the force is  positive. 
    The force increases as the slope of <m>U(x)</m> increases. The point in the middle, 
    at <m>x = 0</m>, is is a minimum of <m>U(x)</m> and hence the slope is zero. Therefore the x-directed 
    force F at that point is zero as well. A point at which the force on an object is zero 
    is a point of <term>static equilibrium</term> [<xref ref="subsubsec-state_eqlbrm"/>], 
    i.e., a particle is at rest and will remain there at rest. 
    If the particle is displaced by a small distance to the right or the left 
    of the equilibrium point, the force pushes the particle back towards equilibrium. 
    Points where the force is zero and small displacements cause a restoring force to 
    bring the particle  back to the same points are called <term>stable equilibrium</term> 
    points [<xref ref="sec_ninth-intro"/>]. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember force is a negative gradient of the potential energy, i.e., 
    <me>
      \vec{F}= -\frac{\,dU}{\,dr} \qquad [\because U(r) = W= -\vec{F}\cdot\,dr]
    </me>
   <me>
    \text{or,}\quad \vec{F_{x}}= -\frac{\,dU}{\,dx};

   <me>
    \vec{F_{y}}= -\frac{\,dU}{\,dy};
   </me>
   <me>
    \text{and}\quad\vec{F_{z}}= -\frac{\,dU}{\,dz}
   </me>
   That is, the force is a negative slope of the potential energy function in 
   its direction. If a particle moves in the direction of the  (conservative) 
   force, it speeds up and its kinetic energy increases.

    The forces between neutral atoms are extremely small, nearly zero, if atoms 
    are very far away from one another. This is illustrated as an extended region 
    where the potential energy is flat for large r as shown in <xref ref="potEcurve"/>. 
    Such region is called <term>neutral equilibrium</term> [<xref ref="sec_ninth-intro"/>] 
    because there are no forces that either restore or repel the two atoms. 
    When two atoms reaches closer, their interaction becomes first weakly attractive 
    due to quantum dipole-induced dipole interactions and then weakly repulsive as the 
    two atoms start to touch each other. There is a potential energy minimum in between 
    where two atoms separated by a certain distance can be in stable equilibrium without 
    being chemically bound. If atoms approaches more closely then they encounter a second 
    potential energy well that is at first strongly attractive to an actual chemical 
    interaction between them followed by a hard core repulsion as the electron clouds 
    are prevented from interpenetrating by the Pauli exclusion principle. This second 
    potential energy well is often modeled by a Lenard-Jones potential energy corresponding 
    to the inverse powers of r. It also has a point of stable equilibrium. In between, 
    there is a point where the growing attraction of the inner potential energy well 
    and the growing repulsion of the outer potential energy well balance, so that the 
    potential energy function has a maximum. At this maximum the slope is zero, 
    a position of force equilibrium but because the force on either side of this 
    point pushes the particle away from it, this is a point of <term>unstable equilibrium</term>. 
    Unstable equilibria occur at isolated maxima in the potential energy function, 
    just as stable equilibria occur at isolated minima. <fn>Introductory Physics-I, Robert Brown, Duke University</fn>

  <title>Loop-the-Loop Track</title>
  <p>
    A loop-the-loop track <idx><h>loop-the-loop track</h></idx> consists of an incline plane
    that leads into a circular loop of radius <m>r</m>. When a body at rest is released 
    from a certain minimum height <m>h_{min}</m> of the inclined plane it will make 
    around the loop without falling. Assuming no friction during motion. 
    The height of the ramp from where the body is released must be so chosen that 
    when the body reaches at the top of the loop, it must be moving with the certain 
    minimum velocity in order to have necessary centripetal force. At the top point 
    B of the loop the weight <m>w</m> and normal force <m>N</m> are acting  on the body downward. 
    These forces must be providing a necessary centripetal force. Remember centripetal force 
    is a resulting force it is not something that acts on the body. It must be provided 
    by some other causing forces which can act on the body.  Hence at point B,
    <me>
      N+w=F_{c}
    </me>
    <me>
      \text{or,}\quad N+mg=\frac{mv_{B}^{2}}{r}
    </me>
   For <m>v_{B}</m> to be minimum, <m>N\to 0</m>. 
   <me>
    \therefore mg = \frac{mv_{min}^{2}}{r} 
   </me>
   <me>
    g=\frac{v_{min}^{2}}{r}
   </me>
   <men xml:id="eqn-ll_track1">
    \therefore v_{min} = \sqrt{gr} 
   </men>

    Now from the principle of conservation of energy 
    <me>
      E_{B} = E_{A}.

   <me>
    \text{or,}\quad KE_{B}+PE_{B}=KE_{A}+PE_{A}
   </me>
   <me>
    \text{or,}\quad \frac{1}{2}mv_{B}^{2}+mg(2r)=0+mgh_{A}
   </me>
  For <m>h_{A}</m> to be <m>h_{min}</m>, <m>v_{B} = v_{min}.</m>
  <me>
    \text{or,}\quad \frac{1}{2}mv_{min}^{2}+mg(2r)=mgh_{min}
  </me>
  <me>
    \text{or,}\quad \frac{1}{2}m(gr)+mg(2r)=mgh_{min}
  </me>
  [from eqn. <xref ref="eqn-ll_track1"/>]
<men xml:id="eqn-ll_track2">
  \therefore h_{min} = \frac{r}{2}+2r =\frac{5}{2}  r
</men>
If the height of incline (ramp) is less than <m>\frac{5r}{2} </m> the body will not 
make a complete cycle around the loop and must fall during its vertical motion inside the loop.
