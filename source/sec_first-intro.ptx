  <title>Physical Quantities</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      There are three fundamental physical quantities, length, mass, and time which 
      are independent to one another. However, to completely express our daily life 
      physical events these three quantities would not be sufficient so some more physical 
      quantities were included later in the list of fundamental quantity and are altogether 
      known as the base quantities. Their units are called  <em>fundamental or base units</em>. 
      The units of  all other physical quantities can be expressed  as combinations of the 
      base units. Such units obtained for the physical quantities are called the  
      <em>derived units</em>. A complete set of these  units, both the  base  units  
      and  derived  units,  is known as the system of units. The diverse human history 
      and geo-political issues gave birth to many systems of units some of them are now 
      obsolete and some of them are still in use at different parts of world. 
      The three different systems of units are considered here for discussion. 
      They are FPS (foot pound second), MKS (meter kilogram second) systems, and  CGS 
      (centimeter gram second). The FPS system  of units is  also called British system 
      and  MKS system is also called a metric  system. The metric system is  a  
      decimalized  system  of  measurement developed  in France  in late <m>18^{th}</m> 
      century. Since  the metric  system  is  almost  universally  used,  it  is  
      often  referred to  as  the  International  System  of Units and abbreviated SI. 
      Since SI units use decimal system, unit conversion within the system is quite simple 
      and convenient. The systems of units are summarized in <alert>table 1.1</alert>.

  <title>Dimensional Analysis</title>
  <p>
    We can express the derived physical quantity by the dimensions of the base quantities. 
    The dimensions of mass, length, and time are written as [M], [L], and [T], respectively. 
    The square brackets round the letter represent dimensions of a base quantity. 
    The dimensions of any other quantity will involve one or more of these basic dimensions. 
    For example, the  volume occupied by an object can be expressed as a product of length, 
    breadth, and height, hence the dimensions of volume are <m>[L]\times [L]\times [L]=[L]^{3}</m>. 
    Similarly, velocity is a distance divided by a time, and hence the dimensions of velocity 
    are  <m>[L][T]^{-1}</m>. The dimensional equations of speed [v], force [F] and mass 
    density <m>[\rho]</m> can be expressed as <m>[v]=[M^{o}LT^{-1}]</m>, <m>[F]=[MLT^{-2}]</m>, 
    and <m>[\rho]=[ML^{-3}T^{o}]</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dimensional analysis is a method in which the relationship between different physical 
    quantities (or units) can be analyzed by identifying their base quantities (or units). 
    Dimensional analysis helps convert the  units of one system into another system or 
    helps check the resulting formula in a physical process. Some quantities have no 
    dimensions and they are called dimensionless quantities, e.g. the ratio of two 
    lengths are dimensionless. The dimensional consistency does  not guarantee the 
    correctness of equations. It is uncertain to the extent of dimensionless  quantities 
    or functions. Dimensional analysis is based on the principle of homogeneity which 
    states that the dimensions of both sides of an equation are same.  For example, 
    in the equation below dimension on left is equal to dimension on right. </p>
    <me>
      x=x_{o}+v_{o}t+\frac{1}{2}at^{2}.
    </me>
    
    <p> To verify that let us use the principle of homogeneity, i.e.,
      <me>
        [L]=[L]+[LT^{-1}][T] + [LT^{-2}][T]^{2} = [L]+[L]+[L] =3[L]
      </me>
which implies that both sides of the equation has the same dimension, hence  this 
equation is a dimensionally correct. It must be noted that  a dimensionally correct 
equation  need not be an  exact (correct) equation, but a dimensionally wrong (incorrect) 
equation must be wrong. </p>
<p>
Use principle of homogeneity to find the time period of the oscillation of a 
simple pendulum  which is dependent on its mass,  length, and the acceleration 
due to gravity.<idx><h>principle of homogenity</h></idx> From the given information, we have -
<me>
  time \varpropto  mass^a* (length)^b* g^c
</me>
or,
<me>
  T = K* M^a* L^b* g^c
</me>
[where K is a dimensionless quantity]

<me>
  or,\quad [M^{o}L^{o}T] = [M]^a* [L]^b*[L*T^-2]^c = [M^{a}L^{b+c}T^{-2c}]
</me>

Equating the power on both sides of the dimensional equation, we get -
<m>a=0, \quad b+c=0, \quad -2c=1 \Rightarrow \quad c=-\frac{1}{2},</m>
and <m>b=-c=\frac{1}{2},</m> 
<m>\qquad\therefore\quad t =K \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}</m>

  <p>Some derived units are summarized in the table 1.2.</p>

  <title>Errors in Measurement</title>
  <p>
    Measurement is a base of science. In every measurement there is some  uncertainty. 
    This uncertainty  is  called an error. The concept of errors can be understood by 
    knowing the terms accuracy and precision. Accuracy refers to how closely a measured 
    value agrees with the correct (true) value. Precision refers to how closely individual 
    measurements agree with each other. For example, suppose the true value of a certain 
    length is near 5.678 cm. In one experiment, the measured value is found to be  5.5 cm 
    by using a measuring instrument of resolution 0.1 cm, while  in  another  experiment, 
    the length is determined to be 5.38 cm by using a measuring device of greater resolution, 
    say 0.01 cm. The first measurement is  more  accurate (as it  is closer to the true value) 
    but less precise (as its resolution  is  only  0.1  cm),  while  the second  measurement 
    is less  accurate but more  precise.  Thus  every  measurement is approximate due to 
    errors in measurement. In general, the  errors can be classified as 
    (a) systematic errors and (b) random errors. The errors that appear due to faulty 
    instruments or imperfact instrumental design are known as systematic errors. 
    It is a repeatable error in the measurement. The systematic errors are 
  </p>
  <ol marker="a.">
    <li>
      <p>
        <term>Instrumental errors:</term> These errors arise due to imperfact calibration 
        or design of the measuring instrument. Usually they are called a <em>Zero Error</em>. 
        It is either a positive or a negative type. These errors can be removed by correcting 
        the measuring device, e.g., in vernier calipers the zero mark of vernier scale may 
        not coincide with the zero mark of the main scale.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <term>Personal errors:</term> They arise due to wrong observations, an individual's bias, 
        lack of proper setting of the apparatus, e.g., parallax error, a person viewing a car's 
        speedometer from the driver's seat will get an accurate reading because she has a 
        direct line of sight. A person viewing the speedometer from the passenger seat will 
        overestimate the reading because of the viewing angle between his eye, the meter, 
        and the arrow.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    The errors that appear due to system noise or disturbance of measuring location are 
    known as random errors. It is a unpredictable and non-repeatable. Experimental error 
    is one of the random errors. Experimental errors arise  due to some external conditions 
    of the instrument such as pressure, temperature, humidity, or magnetic fields, e.g., 
    a  thermometer  placed under  the  armpit  will  always  give  a temperature lower than 
    the actual value of the  body  temperature. This type of errors may also occur due to 
    random and unpredictable fluctuations in experimental conditions (e.g. variation in 
    temperature, supply voltage, local atmospheric pressure, etc) and personal errors 
    (e.g., change in readings if the observer repeats the same observation).

<subsection xml:id="subsec-sigfig">
  <title>Significant Figures</title>
  <introduction>
   

  <p>
    Significant figures are the digits which give us useful information about the accuracy of 
    a measurement. The result of a measurement includes  digits that are known reliably 
    and the last digit that is uncertain. For example, the  length  of an  object measured 
    to be <m>287.5</m> cm when measured with a meterstick marked with centimeter 
    (0.1 resolution) and has four  significant  figures, the  digits  2,  8,  7  
    are certain while the last digit 5 is uncertain. If someone measure the same 
    object with another meterstick marked with millimeters (0.01 resolution) 
    one could have measured the length to be 287.54 cm and that contains 5 significant 
    figures, the  digits 2, 8, 7, and 5  are certain while the last digit 4 is uncertain. 
    Each smaller measurement allows observers to determine the length of the object with 
    a bit more accuracy. Maybe someother can measure with great accuracy as 287.542 cm. 
    No matter what you do, there must be some inaccuracy always come at every measurement. 
    Scientists account for this unavoidable uncertainty in measurement by using significant 
    digits. significant digits do not remove the uncertainty but warn readers to where 
    uncertainty lies.  
  </p>

  <p>
    <m>1000</m> has one significant digit: only 1 is interesting and reliable. 
    The zeroes may have been just the placeholders; they may have rounded something off to 
    get this value.  </p>
<p>
  1000.0 has five significant digits: the ".0" tells us about the accuracy of 
  the measurement that the measurement is accurate to the tenths place.
</p>
<p>
  In scientific notation if 200 has two significant figures then <m>2.0\times10^{2}</m> is used. 
  If it has three sig.fig. then <m>2.00\times10^{2}</m> is used. If it had four then 
  200.0 is sufficient. 
</p>
<p>Here are some basic rules to determine significant figures:</p>

<ol marker="i.">
  <li>
    <p>
      All nonzero digits are significant; in number 0.003004500 the digits 3, 4, and 5 are significant. 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      All zeroes between significant digits are significant; in number 0.003004500 
      the 0, 0 between 3 and 4 are significant.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Trailing zeros in the decimal portion are significant; in number 0.003004500 
      the 0,0 at end of 5 are significant.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Trailing zeroes in a whole number with no decimal shown are not significant; in number "540" 
      there are only two sig.fig. 5 and 4, the last 0 is not significant.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Leading zeroes in the decimal portion to the first non-zero digit are not significant; 
      in number 0.003004500 the 0 to the right of decimal point and digits 0, 0 to the left 
      of decimal point before the digit 3 are not significant.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Exponential digits in scientific notation are not significant; 
      <m>1.32\times 10^{6}</m> has only three significant figures, 1, 3, and 2.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
</introduction>

<subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-rounding_off">
  <title>Rounding off the Numbers</title>
  <p>
    When rounding, we examine the digit following to the right of the digit that 
    is to be the last digit in the rounded off number. The digit we are examining 
    is the first digit to be dropped. 
  </p>
  <p>
    If digit to be dropped off is less than 5, then drop it off with all 
    the other digits to the right of it. 
  </p>
  <p>
    If the digit to be dropped off is greater than 5, then increase the number 
    by 1 to the preceeding digit to be rounded.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the digit to be dropped is 5, then round the preceeding digit so that 
    it will become even number. Zero is considered to be even when rounding off. 
    This is the process of minimizing systematic error. Here are some examples:
  </p>
  <ol marker="i.">
    <li>
      <p>
        Round 742,396 to four, three, and two significant digits: To round to four sig. fig. 
        start with the first significant digit, which is the 7. Then count to the right from there. 
        The first four significant digits of 742,396 are the 7, the 4, the 2, and the 3. 
        Just to the right of the 3 is a 9. Because this value is "greater than  5", 
        round the 3 up to 4. Replace the remaining digits (the 9 and the 6) with zeroes. 
        Then: 742,400 (four significant digits). 
      </p>
      <p>
        To round 742,396 to three places, start again with the 7 and include the next 
        two digits, being the 4 and the 2. Since the next digit is a 3, which is "less than 5", 
        leave the 2 alone and don't round up. Replace the three digits after the comma with zeroes. 
        Then: 742,000 (three significant digits).
      </p>
      <p>
        To round 742,396 to two places, use only the first two digits, which are followed 
        by a 2, so don't round up. Instead, just replace the final four digits with zeroes, 
        to get: 740,000 (two significant digits).

        Round 0.07284 to four, three, and two significant digits: To round 0.07284 to 
        four significant digits, start with the first significant digit, which is the 7. 
        (The zero between the decimal point and the 7 is not significant, as it serves only 
        to "place" the 7 into the hundreds place.) There are only three more digits, 
        so all of them will be included in answer. Since no digit follows the 4, there is 
        no information about rounding, so just leave the 4 as it is. Hence, 0.07284 is 
        four sig-digs.
      </p>
      <p>
        When rounding 0.07284 to three sig-digs, the final sig-dig is the 8, 
        which is followed by the 4. Since 4 is less than 5, so simply drop it. 
        Because these sig-digs are after the decimal point, not replace the 4 with a zero. 
        Hence, 0.0728 is three sig-digs.
      </p>
      <p>
        To round 0.07284 to two sig-digs, use the 7 and the 2. Since the 2 is 
        followed by an 8, round the 2 up to 3; drop everything that follows. Hence,
        0.073 is two sig-digs.

        Round 425.35 to four and two significant digits: For four sig.fig. this number 
        is 425.4, because the value to be rounded off (3) is "odd" and followed by a "5", 
        then round the 3 up to 4 and remove the remaining digits. For two sig.fig. 
        it would be 420, because the value to be rounded off (2) is "even" and  followed by
         a "5", then leave 2 as it is and replace the other with zeroes.

        <term>Addition or subtraction:</term> The final result
        should retain <em>as many decimal places as</em> there are in the number with the 
        least decimal places in the data. For example, the sum of the numbers 436.32 g, 
        227.2 g and 0.301 g is 663.821 g by mere arithmetic addition but the least 
        precise measurement (227.2 g) is correct to only one decimal place. 
        Therefore, the final result should  be rounded off to 663.8 g. 
        Similarly, the difference in lengths of 66.25 m and 23.3055 m is  
        <m>66.25 m - 23.3055 m = 42.9445 m</m>. Which can be expressed as 42.94 only.

        <term>Multiplication or division:</term> The final result should retain 
        <em>as many significant figures as</em> are there in the original number with the 
        least significant figures. For example, if mass of an object is measured to be, 
        say, 4.237 g (four significant figures) and its volume is measured to be <m>2.51 cm^{3}</m>, 
        then its density, by mere arithmetic division, is 1.68804780876 <m>g/cm^{3}</m> 
        upto 11 decimal places. But density should be reported to three significant figures.
        <me>
          Density  =\frac{4.237 g}{2.51 cm^{3}}= 1.69\quad g/cm^{3}.
