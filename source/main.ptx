          I would like to thank my colleagues and students for the contributions they have 
          made to improve this book through questionnaires, classroom discussion, and their 
          invaluable feedback and support throughout the writing process. I am especially 
          very grateful to John Gould and Daniel Covington for 
          providing their critical suggestions to organize this book. Without their guidance, 
          this book would not be what it is today. Their knowledge and expertise were instrumental 
          in shaping my journey in writing this book. Finally, I want to express my gratitude to 
          my family for their unwavering encouragement and patience during the many long hours 
          I spent at my desk. Their love and support sustained me through the ups and downs 
          of this project. Several others deserve credit for their generous help in this book.

          Principles of physics uses calculus as a tool to correlate physical theories to 
          mathematical equations to learn physics. This book is a concise form of my lecture 
          notes which I have been delivering in introductory level physics courses for many years. 
          This text is not a replacement of any textbook that has been recommended by the 
          instructor but designed to provide additional materials as my personal teaching 
          activities in calculus-based physics. It is intended  to support introductory level 
          materials at a rapid and an efficient way. Students who want to use this text assume 
          to have a prerequisite knowledge of some basic mathematical skills such as geometry, 
          algebra, trigonometry, and some advanced mathematical tools such as a differential 
          and integral calculus.   </p>
          <p>
            Learning skills by memorization that have been built in many students during 
            other courses, cannot work efficiently in learning physics. Physics is a 
            logical and conceptual based learning hence it requires a completely different 
            pattern of study than simply trying to memorize lists of formulae or examples. 
            This book is organized into two volumes and ten chapters that covers the syllabus 
            of introductory physics at undergraduate level in various universities and colleges. 
            <term>Volume I</term> contains the <em>Basics of Mechanics, Fluid Mechanics, and 
              Thermodynamics. </em>
            <term>Volume II</term>  contains <em>Electricity, Magnetism, Simple Harmonic Motion, 
              Waves, Acoustics, and Optics</em>. These topics have been carefully chosen to provide 
              an introduction to the 
            basic concepts in physics and to give an opportunity to sharpen critical thinking 
            and problem solving skills. The main objective of this book is to learn how to 
            investigate and approach problems in a logical manner. This book strives to 
            guide readers to  learn physics in a logical manner. Many examples and practice 
            problems throughout the text may be helpful to refine physical intuition. </p>
            <p>
              To tackle the physical problems the book uses the 'GUESS' strategy for a 
              systematic gatheing of information and finding realistic and logistic solution. 
              Here is what GUESS stands for.  </p>
              <p>
                <alert>G:</alert> Given, identify the given information and sketch the information if possible. 
              </p>
<p>
  <alert>U:</alert> Unknown, identify the unknown that we are looking for.
</p>
<p>
  <alert>E:</alert> Equation/s, set up the equation from given information.
</p>

<p>
  <alert>S:</alert> Substitute, substitute the number/s in the equation/s.
</p>

<p>
  <alert>S:</alert> Solve, solve the equation to obtain the answer.
