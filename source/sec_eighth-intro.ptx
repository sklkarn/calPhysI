  <title>Hooke's Law</title>
  
   <introduction>
    <p>
      Hook's law states that within the elastic limit, stress is proportional to strain. 
      <term>Stress, <m>\sigma</m>:</term> It is an internal pressure exerted by the material. 
      It is equal and opposite to the applied pressure. Stress is defined as a force per 
      unit cross-sectional area. <me>
        \sigma = F/A.
      </me>
    <term>  Strain, <m>\epsilon</m>:</term> It is a change in dimension of the material per unit 
    original dimension. <me>
      \epsilon = \Delta L/L 
    </me>
    <me>
      \text{or,}\quad\epsilon= \Delta \theta/\theta
    </me>
    <me>
      \text{or,}\quad\epsilon=\Delta V/V
    </me>
       </p>
       <figure xml:id="elst1">

        <image source="elst1.png" width="35%"/>
    </figure>
       <p>
        If the deforming force is applied on a material, initially strain increases gradually 
        and remains proportional to the stress for a certain limit. After this high stress 
        the atoms are pulled permanently away from their equilibrium position in the lattice structure. 
        The maximum stress which the wire can experience and still return to its original 
        length is called the <term>elastic limit</term> and the region is called elastic 
        region as shown in <xref ref="elst1"/>. Hooke's law holds good only within this limit. 
        If the stress is increased beyond this  limit, the ultimate stress point is reached 
        which is the highest point on the stress-strain curve. This is the greatest stress 
        that the material can bear. Brittle materials break suddenly at this point, 
        while some ductile materials can be stretched a little more due to a decrease 
        in the cross-sectional area of the material. But they too break shortly thereafter 
        at the breaking point. This region is called a plastic region.

  <title>Elastic Modulus</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      From Hook's law, 
      <me>
        \sigma \propto \epsilon
      </me>
      <me>
        \text{or,}\quad  \sigma = E.  \epsilon 
      </me>
      where <m>E</m> is a proportionality constant, called modulus of elasticity. 
      It is a material property which defines how stiff is the material.  
      <me>
        \text{or,}\quad E= \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}
      </me>
    Hence modulus of elasticity, <m>E</m> defines stress per unit strain.  Its unit is Pascal (Pa). 
    In the deformation process material stores energy in the form of potential energy or 
    dissipates energy plastically. Stress is not directly measurable. We can calculate stress 
    differently using applied tension, tangential force, compressional force, etc.

  <title>Young's Modulus or Elasticity of Length</title>

  <p>
    Consider a rod of length <m>l_{o}</m> whose top face is fixed and a normal force <m>F</m> 
    is being applied on its bottom face  as shown in <xref ref="youngmod1"/>, 
    then from Hook's law, normal (tensile) stress <m>\propto</m> longitudinal strain,  that is 
    <me>
      \frac{F}{A} =Y \frac{\Delta l}{l_{o}} 
    </me>
     where <m>Y</m> is called Young's modulus, <m>A</m> is cross-sectional area of wire, 
     and <m>l_{o}</m> is an original length. Hence 
     <me>
      Y= \frac{Fl_{o}}{A\Delta l}
     </me>
     <notation>
      <usage><m>Y</m></usage>
       <description>Young's modulus</description>
     </notation>
     Its unit is <m> N/m^{2} or, \,Pascal.</m>
 When a wire under tension is elongated, its width is slightly diminished. 
 This lateral shrinkage constitutes a transverse strain that is equal to the 
 change in the width divided by the original width, i.e., 
 <me>
  e_{trans} = \frac{\Delta D}{D}
 </me>
 The ratio of  the lateral contraction (transverse strain) to the elongation (longitudinal strain) is called <term>Poisson's ratio</term>.
 <me>
  \therefore \quad \eta = -\frac{e_{trans}}{e_{long}} = -\frac{\Delta D/D}{\Delta l/l_{o}}
 </me>
  Tensile deformation is considered positive and compressive deformation is considered negative. 
 The material which does not contract is brittle and the one which contracts is ductile. 
 Poisson ratio of any material lies between 0 to 0.5.

    Consider a cube of surface area <m>A</m> whose volume is being compressed by applying a 
    deforming force <m>F</m> as shown in <xref ref="bulkmod"/>. Now from Hook's law, 
    volumetric stress <m>\propto</m> volumetric strain,  that is 
    <me>
      \frac{F}{A} =B \frac{\Delta V}{V}
    </me>
     where <m>B</m> is called bulk modulus or coefficient of volumetric elasticity. Hence 
     <me>
      B = \frac{\frac{F}{A}}{\frac{\Delta V}{V}} =\frac{FV}{A\Delta V}
     </me>
     Here <m>F</m> is a deforming force, <m>A</m> is surface area of a cube, <m>\Delta V</m> 
     is change in volume <m>V</m>, and <m>-ve</m> sign shows compression.

<subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-sher_mod">
  <title>Shear Modulus (Modulus of Rigidity) or Elasticity of Shape</title>
  <p>
    When a tangential force is applied on one of the faces of any material keeping 
    opposite face fixed, it deforms its shape. Hence from Hook's law, shear stress <m>\propto</m> shear strain. 
    The elastic property of a body that causes the shape of the body to be changed when a 
    stress is applied is called shear stress. The angle of shear, which is a measure of 
    how much the body's shape has been deformed is called shear strain. 
    When the shear stress is removed the body returns to its original shape.

    Consider a cube of sides y whose bottom face is fixed and a tangential force <m>F</m> is

    <me>
      \frac{F}{A} =\sigma \frac{\Delta x}{y}

    where <m>\sigma </m> is called modulus of shape or shear modulus. Hence

      \sigma = \frac{\frac{F}{A}}{\frac{\Delta x}{y}} =\frac{\frac{F}{A}}{\theta} =\frac{F}{A\theta}

    From Hook's law,

    <me>
      \sigma =E\epsilon

    <me>

 Since cross-sectional area, <m>A</m>, length of spring,<m>L</m>, and elastic constant of 
 spring material, <m>E</m> are constant, we can assume 
 <me>k=\frac{AE}{L}</me> which provides 
 stiffness constant of a spring it is also called a force constant. 
 <me>
  \therefore \quad F =k\Delta L \qquad \Rightarrow \quad F \propto x

 where <m>x=\Delta L</m>.

  <title>Elastic Potential Energy</title>
  <p>
    When a force is applied to deform the shape of a material work has been done against 
    the restoring force of a material hence this work is stored in a material in the 
    form of elastic potential energy.  Suppose a wire is stretched to a distance <m>\,dx</m> 
    by applying a deforming force, then work done by the force is given by 
    <me>
      \,dW=F\,dx.
    </me>
     But for a restoring force, 
     <me>
      F=-kx.
     </me>
      Hence work done by a restoring force is given by 
      <me>
        W_{r} = \int\,dW = -\int\limits_{0}^{x}kx\,dx = -\frac{1}{2}kx^{2}
