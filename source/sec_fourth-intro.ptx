        <title>Fundamental and Mechanical Forces</title>
         <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              There are four fundamental forces in nature: gravitational, electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear.
              <term>Gravitational force</term> is the weakest known forces in nature. It is a long range force. 
              It exists due to mass of the objects. <term>Electromagnetic force</term> is also a long range 
              force and is stronger than gravitational force. It exists due to charges of the objects. 
              <term>Strong nuclear force</term> is the strongest known force but it is the shortest range 
              force which only exists inside the nucleus. Its main job is to hold subatomic particles 
              of the nucleus together. (i.e. binding the positively charged protons and neutral 
              neutrons inside the nucleus). <term>Weak nuclear force</term> is weaker than strong 
              nuclear force and electromagnetic force. It is also a very short range force 
              and accounts for the radioactivity in unstable nuclei.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              For a large-scale, electrically neutral objects such as those encountered in this course, 
              the only force that acts at a distance is the gravitational force. All other forces we 
              encounter will be contact forces (mechanical forces) that occur at the boundary of an 
              object where that object physically touches some other object, e.g. <term>tension, friction, 
                normal, and other applied forces</term> [<xref ref="subsec-friction"/>].
                 Actually, mechanical force, or chemical force, 
                or any other kinds of force are all electromagnetic forces. In our daily life almost 
              all force we experienced are electromagnetic force except the force of gravity. 
              Strong nuclear forces are very short range and we do not feel them dispite the 
              fact that it is more powerful than the electromagnetic force. Weak forces are 
              also short range and even weaker than electromagnetic force. <idx><h>mechanical forces</h></idx>

            <p>
              To identify forces acting on a body, first identify the boundary of that object 
              and include the weight of everything inside that boundary. Then identify 
              everything that touches the boundary from outside the object and include 
              an appropriate force for each point of contact.

            <li>
              <p>
                Newton's first law provides the definition of force which states that every 
                object in a state of rest remains at rest or in a state of uniform motion 
                tends to remain in that motion along the same direction, unless an external 
                force is applied onto it. Force is not required to continue the motion of 
                anything which is already in motion.                 
              </p>
              <p>
                The first law is also called a law of inertia.  <term>Inertia</term> is an 
                ability of an object to resist changes in its motion. In other words, we can say the laziness of 
                an object to change its mechanical state is called an inertia. Mass is related to inertia, 
                the bigger the mass the more difficult it is to change its state of rest or motion.

              <p>
                Newton's second law provides the measurement of force which states that the 
                rate of change of momentum is directly proportional to the applied force and 
                its direction is along that change.

                Newton's third law provides the property of force which states that for every 
                action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Meaning, force always comes in pair. 
                If an object <m>A</m> applies the action force on object <m>B</m> then 
                the object <m>B</m> applies the reaction force on the object <m>A</m>. 
                These pair of forces always act on two different objects. For example, if action force is acting on 
                object B then reaction force must be acting on the object A.

                  If you stand on a weighing scale, your weight push the scale down with a force equal to 
                  your weight, then the scale applies the reaction force on you equal to your weight as a 
                  normal force. Remember that even if weight and normal force are equal they are not 
                  always equal and they are completely different forces. You get a normal force 
                  only when you are in contact with the other surface but you have the weight even 
                  if you are above the surface (while jumping) of anything. Suppose you are pushing 
                  the book against a wall, so that it does not fall. In that case, the book pushes 
                  against the wall and the wall pushes back. This interaction is the normal force 
                  and acts on both the book and the wall. None of these forces were equal to the 
                  gravitational force or weight of the book.

          <title>Friction</title>
          <p>
            Friction is a resistive force that opposes or tends to oppose relative motion between 
            two objects. It is a force that exists between the surfaces of contact of the two objects [<xref ref="friction"/>]. 
            If two systems are in contact and stationary relative to each other, then the friction 
            between them is called <term>static friction</term>. This force arises from mechanical 
            interlocking at the microscopic level plus the electrostatic molecular forces that 
            hold the surfaces themselves together. If two systems are in contact and moving relative 
            to one another, then the friction between them is called <term>kinetic friction</term>. 
            This force arises from forming and breaking of microscopic adhesive bonds between atoms 
            on the surfaces plus some mechanical linkage between the small irregularities on the surfaces 
            as shown in <xref ref="friction1"/>. Experimentally it is found that frictional force is 
            proportional to normal force, i.e., 
            <m>f \propto N </m>  as shown in <xref ref="friction2"/>.

          Where proportionality constant <m>\mu</m> is called coefficient of friction. 
          It defines the nature of roughness of the surfaces being in contact. It is a dimensional 
          less quantity. The coefficient of friction is a property of materials and does not 
          change with the angle.  For static friction, <m>f_{s} \leq \mu_{s}</m> N. The symbol <m>\leq</m> 
          implies that static friction can have a maximum value of <m>\mu_{s} N</m>. Static
          friction is a responsive force that increases to be equal and opposite to whatever 
          force is being exerted, up to its maximum limit. Once the applied force exceeds <m> f_{s} (max) </m>, 
          the object moves. Thus, <m>f_{s}(max) = \mu_{s} N</m>. For kinetic friction, <m>f_{k} =\mu_{k} N</m>. 
          Remember the direction of friction is always opposite to the direction of motion 
          or applied force, not in the direction of normal. Hence the above equations has no vector form.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Friction decreases with increase in smoothness of the surfaces of contact as <m>\mu</m> 
          decreases, but if the surfaces are ultra smooth then friction increases because of 
          inter molecular forces starts to act between the two surfaces  as they come very 
          close to each other, due to which it becomes harder to make them slide on each other. 
          Friction is a complex force, and its behavior is still not completely understood. 
          On molecular level friction has no existence. In microscopic level most surfaces 
          look very rough as shown in <xref ref="friction1"/>. Thus, when an object is pushed to 
          move it must raise the object until it can skip the tips of the surface hitting, 
          breaking off the points, or both. A considerable force can be resisted by friction 
          with no apparent motion. Part of the friction is due to adhesive forces between 
          he surface molecules of the two objects, which explains the dependence of 
          friction on the nature of the substances. For example, rubber-soled shoes 
          slip less than those with leather soles. Adhesion varies with substances in 
          contact. Once an object is moving, there are fewer points of contact 
          so less force is required to keep the object moving. At small but nonzero speeds, 
          friction is nearly independent of speed.

          When an object is placed on the surface of an inclined plane and the angle of 
          inclination is being increased slowly then at a particular angle the object just 
          begins to slide, this angle is known an <term>angle of repose, <m>\phi</m></term>. 
          At the angle of repose static frictional force is balanced by one of the components 
          of weight <m>(mg\sin\theta)</m> of the object (see in section statics).

         <term>Force of Gravity:</term> This force is acting on any object due to attraction of 
         earth. Near the surface of the earth force of gravity is given by its weight, 
         i.e., <m>F_{g}=w=mg</m>. Where <m>g</m> is the acceleration due to gravity and the direction 
         force is acting along the center of the earth. <term>Normal:</term> <idx><h>normal</h></idx> 
         This is a force of reaction from the surface where the object is placed. 
         It is always perpendicular to the surface of contact. <term>Tension:</term> <idx><h>tension</h></idx> 
         This force is acting between two objects on opposite ends of the string, in the directions 
         to taut string at the points of contact. This force stretches the string along fixed support. 
         It is a pulling force. <term>Spring force:</term> A spring is a special medium  
         that has ability to restore its shape, if  deformed. All materials have elastic property 
         which helps them to restore their shape, if an applied deforming force has been released. 
         From <term>Hook's law</term> a material (spring) exerts a restoring force that is 
         proportional to a deforming force in opposite direction in which it is stretched or compressed. 
         In mathematical form, 
         <men xml:id="hook_law">
          \vec{F} = -k\vec{x}.
         </men>
         The proportionality constant <m>k</m> is a measure of the spring's stiffness, 
         also called an elastic constant. The line of action of this force is parallel 
         to the spring axis, and acts along the opposite direction of the displacement vector. 
         The displacement must be measured from the relaxed (equilibrium) position;  <m>x = 0</m> 
         when the spring is relaxed.

          <p>
            A system is in static equilibrium whenever no part of the system is moving. 
            An example of static equilibrium is a spider web suspending one or more bugs. 
            Any segment of the web (any bug, any strand, any junction, or any combination thereof) 
            may be treated as a body. </p>

                The vector sum of the forces acting on an object in static equilibrium is equal to zero. 
                which is described by Newton First law <m>\vec{F}  =  0</m>	or, equivalently 
                <me>
                  \vec{F}_{x}  =  0	\quad \text{(x-component of force) and }

                <me>
                  \vec{F}_{y}  =  0	\quad \text{(y-component of force)}.
                </me>
                In static equilibrium, the total force acting on a body, <m>\vec{F}  =  0</m>, 
                <m>\vec{a}=0,</m> and also the velocity of a body <m>\vec{v}  =  0</m>.
