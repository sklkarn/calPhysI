  <title>Torque</title>
  
   <introduction>
    <p>
      The rotational effect of force is called a torque. It is a physical quantity 
      that changes the object's state of rotational motion. It is a rotational 
      analog of force in a linear motion.  It depends on the magnitude, direction and 
      location of force that is acting on the body. Imagine we try to push a door 
      to open it. How much push we apply to rotate the door depends on how far from 
      the hinges (the pivot point <m>O</m>) and the direction we are applying a force. 
      The closer we are to the hinges (the smaller r), the harder it is to push. 
      The torque we created on the door is smaller when we push it near the hinge 
      than it would be away from its hinges.

    <p>
      Consider a force <m>F</m> acts on an object at a distance <m>r</m> 
      from the point of pivot <m>O</m> in such a way that the object rotates 
      about the point <m>O</m>, then the magnitude of the torque 
      <m>\Gamma</m> about the axis of rotation through <m>O</m> is given by

      The shortest distance between line of action of force to the point of 
      rotation of a body is called the <term>lever arm</term> or moment arm. 
      Torque is maximum when force and lever arm are perpendicularly to each other. 
      There will be no torque if a force is applied at the pivot point (point of rotation) 
      since the moment arm would be zero (r = 0). It is a vector quantity and 
      its direction is always perpendicular to the plane describes by a lever 
      arm and a force. Our right hand can be useful to find the direction of torque. 
      Stretch your right hand fingures in the direction of lever arm then curl 
      them in a direction of force. Now thumb must be oriented in the direction 
      of torque. Since torque is associated with three dimensional case but the 
      motion of object we consider here is only in a plane we make it simple 
      by using the following convention.

      Torque is taken as positive (<m>+ve</m>) if it tends to rotate the object 
      counterclockwise, and negative (<m>-ve</m>) if it tends to rotate the object 
      clockwise. The direction of torque and the direction of rotation can be 
      remembered using the right-hand thumb's rule. The thumb of right hand 
      gives the direction of torque, if the fingers curled along the direction 
      of rotation of the body. The torque vector is perpendicular to <m>\vec{r}</m> 
      and <m>\vec{F}</m>. When  torque points into the screen, the rotation is 
      clockwise and when it points out of the screen, the rotation is counter-clockwise. 
      There may be more than one forces acting on an object, and each of these 
      forces may act on different points on the object. Then, each force will 
      cause a torque. The net torque is the sum of the individual torques.

  <title>Rotational Equilibrium</title>
 <p>
  If the force is applied at an angle <m>\theta</m> to the radius vector, 
  then the lever arm is <m>r\times\sin\theta</m>. An object in rotational 
  equilibrium has no net external torque, i.e., sum of all external torques  =  0. 
  <em>Remember</em> that "rotational equilibrium" may mean that the object 
  is either not rotating or may be rotating with a constant angular velocity.

        <term>Stable equilibrium:</term> The body is said to be in stable equilibrium 
        if its center of gravity lies below lowest possible position. A funnel standing 
        vertically on its base on the table is in stable equilibrium [<xref ref="funnel1"/>]. 
        If the funnel is tilted a little bit against any side and then allowed to fall, 
        it will come back to its original position. When the funnel is tilted against 
        any side its center of gravity is raised [<xref ref="funnel1a"/>]. The line of action 
        of weight passes through the base of the funnel. As long as the line of action 
        of weight remains inside the base area funnel will come back to the original position. 
        A torque due to weight of the funnel brings it back to the original position. 
        For the funnel to tip over the line of action of the weight arrow will have to 
        form a clockwise moment (or to pass outside the point of support). 
        The funnel needs to have been pushed a lot for tip over. Some examples of 
        stable equilibrium are bodies lying on the floor such as chair, table, book, etc. 
        If a system in stable equilibrium is disturbed slightly, it oscillates around 
        that state first but eventually settles down in exactly the same position as it 
        started [<xref ref="funnel1b"/>]. It does this because its center of gravity is already 
        at the lowest possible position.

          <term>Unstable equilibrium:</term> The body is said to be in unstable equilibrium 
          if the center of gravity of a body lies above the highest possible position. 
          A funnel standing vertically on its stem on the table [<xref ref="funnel2"/>] is in 
          unstable equilibrium. If the funnel standing vertically is slightly disturbed 
          from its position it will not come back to its original position rather fall 
          down on the surface of table. when the funnel is slightly disturbed its 
          center of gravity is lowered [<xref ref="funnel2a"/>]. The line of action of its 
          weight lies outside the base of stem. The torque due to weight of the rod 
          toppled it down. Other examples of unstable equilibrium are vertically standing 
          cylinder and pencil etc. An unstable system moves away from its original equilibrium 
          state when disturbed. It wants to move away from the original position as 
          soon as it has been disturbed [<xref ref="funnel2b"/>]. It does this because its center 
          of gravity is higher in this state and when disturbed the center of gravity 
          continues to move to a lower position (a more stable one).

          <term>Natural equilibrium:</term>  The body is said to be in natural (neutral) equilibrium 
          if the center of gravity of a body is at optimal position it is neither lowered 
          nor is raised up. The object with lower center of gravity is more stable than 
          the one with the higher center of gravity. A funnel lying horizontally on its 
          side at rest on the surface of a table [<xref ref="funnel3"/>] is in natural equilibrium. 
          If a funnel is pushed slightly to roll, it will neither come back to its original position
          nor it will roll forward rather it will remain at rest. If the funnel is rolled, 
          its center of gravity is neither raised nor lowered [<xref ref="funnel3a"/>]. 
          This means that its center of gravity  is at the same height as before. 
          A neutral system is one where the center of gravity of the system is always at 
          the same level. If it has been disturbed slightly it will therefore settle in 
          the new position without a need to move further on or to move back [<xref ref="funnel3b"/>]. 
          For example, a rolling ball lying on the table.
