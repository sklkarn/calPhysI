  <title>Torque</title>
  
   <introduction>
    <p>
      The rotational effect of force is called a torque. It is a physical quantity 
      that changes the object's state of rotational motion. It is a rotational 
      analog of force in a linear motion.  It depends on the magnitude, direction and 
      location of force that is acting on the body. Imagine we try to push a door 
      to open it. How much push we apply to rotate the door depends on how far from 
      the hinges (the pivot point <m>O</m>) and the direction we are applying a force. 
      The closer we are to the hinges (the smaller r), the harder it is to push. 
      The torque we created on the door is smaller when we push it near the hinge 
      than it would be away from its hinges.

      Consider a force <m>F</m> acts on an object at a distance <m>r</m> 
      from the point of pivot <m>O</m> in such a way that the object rotates 
      about the point <m>O</m>, then the magnitude of the torque 
      <m>\Gamma</m> about the axis of rotation through <m>O</m> is given by

    <p>
      The shortest distance between line of action of force to the point of 
      rotation of a body is called the <term>lever arm</term> or moment arm. 
      Torque is maximum when force and lever arm are perpendicularly to each other. 
      There will be no torque if a force is applied at the pivot point (point of rotation) 
      since the moment arm would be zero (r = 0). It is a vector quantity and 
      its direction is always perpendicular to the plane describes by a lever 
      arm and a force. Our right hand can be useful to find the direction of torque. 
      Stretch your right hand fingures in the direction of lever arm then curl 
      them in a direction of force. Now thumb must be oriented in the direction 
      of torque. Since torque is associated with three dimensional case but the 
      motion of object we consider here is only in a plane we make it simple 
      by using the following convention.

      Torque is taken as positive (<m>+ve</m>) if it tends to rotate the object 
      counterclockwise, and negative (<m>-ve</m>) if it tends to rotate the object 
      clockwise. The direction of torque and the direction of rotation can be 
      remembered using the right-hand thumb's rule. The thumb of right hand 
      gives the direction of torque, if the fingers curled along the direction 
      of rotation of the body. The torque vector is perpendicular to <m>\vec{r}</m> 
      and <m>\vec{F}</m>. When  torque points into the screen, the rotation is 
      clockwise and when it points out of the screen, the rotation is counter-clockwise. 
      There may be more than one forces acting on an object, and each of these 
      forces may act on different points on the object. Then, each force will 
      cause a torque. The net torque is the sum of the individual torques.

  <title>Rotational Equilibrium</title>
 <p>
  If the force is applied at an angle <m>\theta</m> to the radius vector, 
  then the lever arm is <m>r\times\sin\theta</m>. An object in rotational 
  equilibrium has no net external torque, i.e., sum of all external torques  =  0. 
  <em>Remember</em> that "rotational equilibrium" may mean that the object 
  is either not rotating or may be rotating with a constant angular velocity.
