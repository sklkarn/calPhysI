  <title>Fluid Flow</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The motion of fluids is a complicated process but here our discussion will concentrate 
      on ideal fluids' and its motion. Ideal fluids are  incompressible, non-viscous (no internal 
      friction between the fluids' layer), and have laminar flow <idx><h>laminar flow </h></idx> motion. 
      In laminar flow fluid flows with the steady motion or streamline motion. 
      Laminar flow occurs when the fluid flows in infinitesimal parallel layers with no disruption 
      (i.e., no swirls or no eddies) between them. In such flow fluid follows the same velocity 
      and direction at every points of its motion. There are another type of fluid motion called 
      turbulent flows. In such flow fluid moves with changing velocities and directions on every 
      point of its path. Reynolds number is used to distinguish the transition between laminar 
      and turbulent flows. We limit our studies here to turbulent and <term>Reynold's number</term>.

  <title>Equation of Continuity</title>
  <p>
    As a fluid is in steady motion and its flow progresses with time, it must be that the 
    amount of mass flowing per unit time across to areas perpendicular to the flow is conserved. 
    The flow rate is a measure of the flow of mass (volume) of fluid per unit time.

    Consider a tube [<xref ref="econt1"/>] with areas of cross-section <m>A_a</m> at one end and <m>A_b</m> at another end. 
    If <m>\,dm</m> mass of fluid is entering into the tube in time <m>\,dt</m> then the same amount of 
    fluid must be leaving out of the tube in the same interval of time because fluid is incompressible. Hence, 
        flow rate of fluid in laminar flow is same throughout its path, i.e., 
        <me>
          \left.\frac{\,dm}{\,dt}\right]_{a} =\left.\frac{\,dm}{\,dt}\right]_{b} 
        </me>
        <me>
          \text{or,}\quad \rho_{a}\frac{\,dV_{a}}{\,dt} =\rho_{b}\frac{\,dV_{b}}{\,dt}
        </me>
        <me>
          \text{or,}\quad \rho A_{a}\frac{\,dx_{a}}{\,dt} =\rho A_{b}\frac{\,dx_{b}}{\,dt} 
        </me>
        <m>\because \rho_{a}=\rho_{b}=\rho]</m>

    The quantity <m>Av</m> is called a flow rate. This equation is called an equation of continuity.

  <title>Bernoulli's Principle</title>

  <p>
    It explains the movement of fluid through a pressure difference. work done by external 
    force is equal to change in total energy of the fluid. If <m>E_{1}</m> and <m>E_{2}</m> 
    are energy of the fluid  at the ends of the tube where external forces <m>F_{1} </m> 
    and <m>F_{2},</m> are acting normally on the cross-section of the tube, then  
    <me>
      E_{2}-E_{1} = \text{work done by external forces}

    Consider a fluid is moving in a tube as shown in <xref ref="brnp1"/>. 
    Let fluid is entering into the tube with velocity <m>v_{1}</m> and coming out of 
    the tube with velocity <m>v_{2}.</m> The <m>h_{1}</m> and <m>h_{2}</m>  
    are the heights of tube at its ends, respectively and <m>\,dm </m> is the 
    mass of fluid flowing through the tube in time <m>\,dt.</m> Now,
    <me>
      \left(\frac{1}{2}\,dm v^{2}_{2}+\,dm g h_{2}\right)-\left(\frac{1}{2}\,dm v^{2}_{1}+\,dm g h_{1}\right) = F_{1}\,dx_{1}- F_{2}\,dx_{2}
    </me>
    Here <m>\,dx_{1} </m> and <m> \,dx_{2} </m> are the distances of the fluid moves in time <m>\,dt </m> at its ends. Hence, 
    <me>
      \frac{1}{2}\,dV\rho \left(v^{2}_{2}-v^{2}_{1}\right) +\,dV\rho g \left(h_{2}-h_{1}\right) = P_{1}A_{1}\,dx_{1}- P_{2}A_{2}\,dx_{2}=\left(P_{1}-P_{2}\right)\,dV
    </me>
   <me>
    \therefore p_{1} + \rho gh_{1} + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_{1}^{2}  =  p_{2} + \rho gh_{2} + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_{2}^{2} =  constant 
   </me>
   This equation tells us that as the velocity of fluid flow increases, its pressure decreases. 
   This is the conservation of energy principle in fluid motion. Bernoulli's equation says that 
   the sum of the pressure, <m>P</m>, (or, the energy per unit volume), the kinetic energy per 
   unit volume ( <m>\frac{1}{2}\rho v^{2}</m> ), and the gravitational potential energy per 
   unit volume (<m>\rho g h</m>) has the same value at all points along a streamline.

        <title>Airplane Wing</title>
         <p>
        The top of the airplane wing is curved, while the bottom 
         of the wing is totally flat. When an airplane runs air travels across the top of the 
         wing is faster then it travels below the bottom part of the wing so that the air molecules 
         travel equal distance in equal time (<em>equal transit theory</em>) to catch each other 
         at the end of the wing. This phenomenon creates high pressure at the bottom and less 
         pressure at the top. This pressure difference creates lift and allows planes to fly 
         or take off easily [<xref ref="brnairplane"/>].

        <title>Spinning Ball</title>
        <p>
          The ball spins in such a way that it decreases 
          the velocity of air at top and increases the the velocity of air on the bottom. 
          Which allows more air pressure on the top of the ball and less air pressure at the 
          bottom of the ball. Due to which the ball accelerates downwards faster than the 
          top part and the ball curves downward, which causes the batter to miscalculate 
          the ball's position [<xref ref="brnspnball"/>].

          <title>Venturi Meter</title>
        <p>
          It is a device used to measure the speed of the fluid. 
          It is a broad tube with constriction at the middle as shown in <xref ref="venturi"/>. 
          A manometer of U-shape is attached to it with one arm at the broad side and 
          the other at the constriction. When the speed of incompressible fluid increases 
          at the constriction, it lowers the pressure at that point. The pressure difference 
          causes the manometer fluid (water) in the tube to rise in one arm and depressed 
          at the other arm. The difference in height, <m>h</m> measures the pressure 
          difference. From Bernoulli's principle

        p_{1}-p_{2} = \frac{1}{2}\rho v_{2}^{2}-\frac{1}{2}\rho v_{1}^{2}
      </me>
          Since the horizontal axis of the venturi meter is passing through the points M and N  
          is at same height. Therefore <m>\rho g h_{1} = \rho g h_{2}.</m>

            From equation of continuity,

              The pressure difference between points M and N is also the pressure difference between 
              the manaometer fluid at two points. That is the top of the water column on the left-hand 
              side of the U-tube and the water column on the right-hand side. Hence, 
              <me>
                p_{1}-p_{2} = h\rho_{w}g 
              </me>
              where <m>h\rho_{w}g </m> is a gauge pressure in manometer. 
              <men xml:id="eqn-vent4">
                \therefore \quad h\rho_{w}g  = \frac{1}{2}\rho v_{1}^{2} \left[\left(\frac{A_{1}}{A_{2}}\right)^{2}- 1 \right] 
              </men>
             This equation will help find the speed of fluid  (gas or liquid) entering into the venturi tube.

        <title>Siphon Effect</title>
         <p>
         when one end of a pipe is deep into liquid and suck the air out from 
         another end then there is vacuum created in the pipe and pressure gets low with respect to the 
         atmospheric pressure at the surface of reservoir. This reduced pressure sucks the liquid up 
         against the gravity and hence once the liquid rises up to the top of the pipe and due to gravity 
         it begins flowing to the lower end of the siphon pipe to exit [<xref ref="siphon"/>].

    There are numerous applications of Bernoulli's principle found in our daily life,
