  <introduction>
    <p>
      The motion of object along a two directions has been analyzed in 2D kinematics. 
      An object fired into the air moves in a vertical as well as horizontal directions. 
      Such motion occurs in a two‐dimensional plane. The horizontal motion in a plane 
      over the earth's surface is also a two‐dimensional motion.
      The position vector of a particle in 2D is given by <m>\vec{r}  =  \vec{r}\{x(t),y(t)\}</m>.

    <p>
      Projectile is a particle which has both horizontal as well as vertical motions. 
      For example, a baseball in flight is a projectile. To analyze the projectile motion, 
      three basic assumptions are made: 
      <ol>
        <li>
          acceleration due to gravity is constant and is directed downward, 
        </li>
        <li>
          the effect of air resistance is negligible, and
        </li>
        <li>
          the surface of the earth is flat.
        </li>
      </ol>
      To analyze the projectile motion, two‐dimensional motion is separated into vertical 
      and horizontal motions. The object in vertical motion experiences constant 
      acceleration due to gravity. The object in horizontal motion on the other hand 
      experiences no acceleration and hence it maintains a constant horizontal 
      velocity through out its motion. Suppose a particle is thrown from the origin with an 
      initial velocity (<m>v_{o}</m>), along an angle <m>\theta_{o}</m> from the ground level as 
      shown in <xref ref="proj1"/>, then the x- and y- components of the initial velocity are given by 
      <men xml:id="eqn-proj1">
        v_{ox} = v_{o}\cos\theta_{o} 
      </men>
      and 
      <men xml:id="eqn-proj2">
         v_{oy} = v_{o}\sin\theta_{o} 
      </men>
      The horizontal distance covered by the projectile in any time <m>t</m> is given by 
      <men xml:id="eqn-proj3">
        x  =  v_{ox} t  \qquad  [\because a=constant]
      </men>
      The vertical distance covered by the projectile in any time <m>t</m> is given by 
      <men xml:id="eqn-proj4">
        y  =  v_{oy} t - \frac{1}{2} g t^{2} \qquad [\because a=-g]   
      </men>
      here <m>g</m> is taken as positive for downward direction. Hence velocities and angle of a 
      projectile after time <m>t</m> is given by 
      <men xml:id="eqn-proj5">
        v_{x}  =  v_{ox} 
      </men>
      <men xml:id="eqn-proj6">
        v_{y}  =  v_{oy}  -  g t   
      </men>
      and 
      <men xml:id="eqn-proj7">
      \tan\theta  = \frac{v_{y}}{v_{x}} \quad \Rightarrow \theta =tan^{-1}\left( \frac{v_{y}}{v_{x}}\right) 
      </men>
       </p>
       <p>
        The time taken by the projectile to reach its highest point, 
        <m>H</m> and falls to the ground again is called a time of flight <m>T</m>. 
        The time for the projectile to reach the ground from its highest point is 
        equal to the time of fall for a freely falling object that falls straight 
        down from the same height. This is because an object in flight only experiences 
        vertical force (weight of the object) in vertical motion but not in horizontal 
        motion as soon as it is released from the thrower's hand. Projectile paths 
        are parabolic and, therefore, symmetric. The object reaches the top of its 
        rise in half of the total time of flight <m>T</m>. At the top of the rise, 
        the vertical velocity is zero. These facts can be used to derive the horizontal distance 
        traveled by the projectile, also called the range <m>R</m>. At maximum height, 
        <m>v_{y} = 0</m> and <m>t = \frac{T}{2}</m>; therefore, the time of 
        flight using eqns. <xref ref="eqn-proj6"/> and <xref ref="eqn-proj2"/>

      An object moving in a circular path is called a circular motion. 
      In a uniform circular motion the direction of velocity is constantly 
      changing but its magnitude remains constant. This constantly changing 
      velocity vector produces the acceleration on an object which is pointed 
      towards the center of a circle, called a centripetal acceleration. For this 
      acceleration to happen there must exists a resultant force which is called the 
      centripetal force. The centripetal force is not a physical force like frictional 
      force, normal force, or gravity force, etc. it does not act on a body but it 
      makes the body to rotate in a circle.  This is a <term>resulting force</term> 
      rather than a <term>causing force</term> like tension in a string, 
      normal force acting on a body, frictional force between the surfaces of contact, 
      and all fundamental forces. It is an unbalanced force. 
      [<alert>Note</alert> that the causing force always comes in pair.] 
      If <m>r</m> is the radius of the path, and <m>T</m> is the time period, 
      the time it takes to complete a circle, then its speed (linear) is given by 
      <me>
        v = \frac{s}{t} = \frac{2\pi r}{T}
      </me>
      For a uniform circular motion centripetal acceleration <m>a_{c} = a_{r}</m>, is pointed 
      along the radial direction towards its center and the tangential acceleration 
      <m>a_{t}</m> is zero. For a non-uniform circular motion there is still a radial 
      acceleration <m>a_{c} = a_{r}</m> but the tangential acceleration <m>a_{t}</m> is 
      non-zero pointed along the direction of velocity. If the centripetal force 
      vanishes, the object flies off at a tangent to the circle.

      Consider a particle rotating in a circular path and reaches to point A 
      from point B in a small time interval <m>\,dt</m>. The velocity vectors of the 
      particle are <m>\vec{v}_{1}</m> at point A and  <m>\vec{v}_{2}</m> at point B. 
      The angular displacement subtends by the particle between point A and B 
      is <m>\,d\theta</m> as shown in <xref ref="cir2"/>.
    </p>
    <p>
      From quadrilateral OAMB of <xref ref="cir2"/>, <m>\angle AOB+\angle AMB =180^{o}</m>

      Now from radian formula,

        \,d\theta=\frac{\widehat{AB}}{r} = \frac{\,ds}{r}

    where <m>a=a_{c}=\frac{v^{2}}{r}</m>, is a centripetal acceleration. 
    In uniform circular motion <m>a_{c}=a_{r}</m> is called the radial

    <title>Angular Displacement, <m>\theta</m>:</title>
    <p>
      The angle subtends by an object when rotating in a circular path about 
      an axis is called the angular displacement. In a 2D space, angular displacement 
      describes a rotation of an object and is a simply number, a scalar. 
      However, in 3D space, direction of the axis of rotation of an object 
      need to be specified and hence it behaves as a vector. The direction of 
      the vector is the direction of the axis of rotation, and the magnitude 
      is how big the rotation was. Since angular displacement does not follow 
      all the vectors rule in 2 dimension hence it is not taken as a vector quantity. 
      For angular rotation in 2D, 
      <me>\vec{\theta_{1}}+\vec{\theta_{2}}\neq\vec{\theta_{2}}+\vec{\theta_{1}}</me>, 
      i.e. not commutative for large angles. Suppose you have two pencils parallel 
      to each other facing tips opposite to you. You rotate first pencil to <m>90^{o}</m> 
      about vertical axis so that tip facing left side, then rotate it again by <m>90^{o}</m> 
      about a horizontal axis so that its tip facing upward. Now rotate the 
      second pencil by <m>90^{o}</m> about the horizontal axis so that its 
      tip facing upward and again rotate it by <m>90^{o}</m> about a another 
      horizontal axis so that tip facing left. Now you can see that they 
      have different orientations, not parallel any more.

    <title>Angular Velocity, <m>\omega</m>:</title>
    <p>
      The angular velocity, <m>\omega</m> of an object is defined as the rate

      It is measured in unit (<m>rad/s</m>). It is a vector quantity and its 
      direction is along the direction of axis of rotation defined by right 
      hand thumb rule. If fingers of right hand are curled in the direction 
      of rotation of the body then thumb pointed along the direction of angular velocity.

      quantity. It is related to angular velocity in the same way as circular 
      motion is related to simple harmonic motion. If an object goes around 
      a circle path once in a certain time T (in seconds), then it has subtended 
      <m>2\pi</m> radians angle, and its angular velocity is thus
